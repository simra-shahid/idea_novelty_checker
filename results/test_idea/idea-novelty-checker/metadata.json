{"input": {"idea": "Hierarchical Topic Models (HTMs) are useful for discovering topic hierarchies in a collection of documents. However, traditional HTMs often produce hierarchies where lowerlevel topics are unrelated and not specific enough to their higher-level topics. Additionally, these methods can be computationally expensive. We present HyHTM - a Hyperbolic geometry based Hierarchical Topic Models - that addresses these limitations by incorporating hierarchical information from hyperbolic geometry to explicitly model hierarchies in topic models. Experimental results with four baselines show that HyHTM can better attend to parent-child relationships among topics. HyHTM produces coherent topic hierarchies that specialise in granularity from generic higher-level topics to specific lowerlevel topics. Further, our model is significantly faster and leaves a much smaller memory footprint than our best-performing baseline.We have made the source code for our algorithm publicly accessible.", "input_papers_ids": [], "use_retrieval": true}, "output": {"idea_keywords": ["Hyperbolic geometry in topic modeling", "Hierarchical information from hyperbolic geometry", "Coherent topic hierarchies specialization", "Efficient hierarchical topic modeling", "Parent-child relationships in topic models"], "title_keywords": ["HyHTM: Hyperbolic Topic Modeling", "Efficient Hyperbolic Topic Hierarchies", "Coherent Hierarchies via HyHTM", "Hyperbolic Geometry for Topic Models"], "idea_priority_facets": "<facets>\n- Application Domain: Hierarchical topic modeling in document collections.\n- Purpose: To improve the specificity and coherence of topic hierarchies and reduce computational expense.\n- Mechanism: Incorporating hierarchical information from hyperbolic geometry.\n- Method: Developing HyHTM, a Hyperbolic geometry-based Hierarchical Topic Model.\n- Evaluation: Comparison with four baselines, focusing on parent-child relationship coherence, granularity specialization, computational speed, and memory footprint.\n- Additional Information: Public accessibility of the source code for the algorithm.\n</facets>"}}
