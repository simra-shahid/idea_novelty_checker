However, they generally hold the Euclidean embedding space assumption, leading to a basic limitation in capturing hierarchical relations. To this end, we present a novel framework that introduces hyperbolic embeddings to represent words and topics. With the tree-likeness property of hyperbolic space, the underlying semantic hierarchy among words and topics can be better exploited to mine more interpretable topics. Furthermore, due to the superiority of hyperbolic geometry in representing hierarchical data, tree-structure knowledge can also be naturally injected to guide the learning of a topic hierarchy. Therefore, we further develop a regularization term based on the idea of contrastive learning to inject prior structural knowledge efficiently. Experiments on both topic taxonomy discovery and document representation demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves improved performance against existing embedded topic models.\n\n2: Hierarchical Topic Modeling via Contrastive Learning and Hyperbolic Embedding.

International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Hierarchical topic modeling, which can mine implicit semantics in the corpus and automatically construct topic hierarchical relationships, has received considerable attention recently. However, the current hierarchical topic models are mainly based on Euclidean space, which cannot well retain the implicit hierarchical semantic information in the corpus, leading to irrational structure of the generated topics. On the other hand, the existing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based neural topic models perform satisfactorily, but they remain constrained by pattern collapse due to the discontinuity of latent space. To solve the above problems, with the hypothesis of hyperbolic space, we propose a novel GAN-based hierarchical topic model to mine high-quality topics by introducing contrastive learning to capture information from documents. Furthermore, the distinct tree-like property of hyperbolic space preserves the implicit hierarchical semantics of documents in topic embeddings, which are projected into the hyperbolic space. Finally, we use a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn implicit hierarchical semantics of topics and mine topic structure information. Experiments on real-world corpora demonstrate the remarkable performance of our model on topic coherence and topic diversity, as well as the rationality of the topic hierarchy.\n\n3: Navigating Memorability Landscapes: Hyperbolic Geometry Reveals Hierarchical Structures in Object Concept Memory.

Prior studies have suggested that features (e.g., color, animacy, etc.) and typicality (e.g., robin vs. penguin) of object images influences the likelihood of being remembered. However, a complete understanding of object memorability remains elusive. In this study, we examine whether the geometric relationship between object concepts explains differences in their memorability. Specifically, we hypothesize that image concepts will be geometrically arranged in hierarchical structures and that memorability will be explained by a concept\u2019s depth in these hierarchical trees. To test this hypothesis, we construct a Hyperbolic representation space of object concepts (N=1,854) from the THINGS database (Hebart et al., 2019), which consists of naturalistic images of concrete objects, and a space of 49 feature dimensions derived from data-driven models. Using ALBATROSS (Stier, A. J., Giusti, C., & Berman, M. G., In prep), a stochastic topological data analysis technique that detects underlying structures of data, we demonstrate that Hyperbolic geometry efficiently captures the hierarchical organization of object concepts above and beyond a traditional Euclidean geometry and that hierarchical organization is related to memorability. We find that concepts closer to the center of the representational space are more prototypical and also more memorable. Importantly, Hyperbolic distances are more predictive of memorability and prototypicality than Euclidean distances, suggesting that concept memorability and typicality are organized hierarchically. Taken together, our work presents a novel hierarchical representational structure of object concepts that explains memorability and typicality.\n\n4: Brain-Inspired AI with Hyperbolic Geometry.

Inspired by studies on the latent geometry of the brain, in this perspective paper we posit that an increase in the research and application of hyperbolic geometry in ANNs and machine learning will lead to increased accuracy, improved feature space representations and more efficient models across a range of tasks. We examine the structure and functions of the human brain, emphasising the correspondence between its scale-free hierarchical organization and hyperbolic geometry, and reflecting on the central role hyperbolic geometry plays in facilitating human intelligence. Empirical evidence indicates that hyperbolic neural networks outperform Euclidean models for tasks including natural language processing, computer vision and complex network analysis, requiring fewer parameters and exhibiting better generalisation. Despite its nascent adoption, hyperbolic geometry holds promise for improving machine learning models through brain-inspired geometric representations.\n\n5: Continuous Geometry-Aware Graph Diffusion via Hyperbolic Neural PDE.

In this paper, by envisioning depth as a continuous-time embedding evolution, we decouple the HGNN and reframe the information propagation as a partial differential equation, letting node-wise attention undertake the role of diffusivity within the Hyperbolic Neural PDE (HPDE). By introducing theoretical principles \\textit{e.g.,} field and flow, gradient, divergence, and diffusivity on a non-Euclidean manifold for HPDE integration, we discuss both implicit and explicit discretization schemes to formulate numerical HPDE solvers. Further, we propose the Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Equation (HGDE) -- a flexible vector flow function that can be integrated to obtain expressive hyperbolic node embeddings. By analyzing potential energy decay of embeddings, we demonstrate that HGDE is capable of modeling both low- and high-order proximity with the benefit of local-global diffusivity functions. Experiments on node classification and link prediction and image-text classification tasks verify the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently outperforms various competitive models by a significant margin.\n\n6: Hierarchical Symbolic Reasoning in Hyperbolic Space for Deep Discriminative Models.

In this paper, Boolean models in hyperbolic space are considered, where one takes the union of the particles of a stationary Poisson process in the space of compact (convex) subsets of the hyperbolic space. Geometric functionals such as the volume of the intersection of the Boolean model with a compact convex observation window are studied. In particular, the asymptotic behavior for balls with increasing radii as observation windows is investigated. Exact and asymptotic formulas for expectations, variances, and covariances are shown and univariate and multivariate central limit theorems are derived. Compared to the Euclidean framework, some new phenomena can be observed.\n\n8: Hyperbolic Graph Topic Modeling Network with Continuously Updated Topic Tree.

Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 8\nAbstract: Connectivity across documents often exhibits a hierarchical network structure. Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promise in preserving network hierarchy. However, they do not model the notion of topics, thus document representations lack semantic interpretability. On the other hand, a corpus of documents usually has high variability in degrees of topic specificity. For example, some documents contain general content (e.g., sports), while others focus on specific themes (e.g., basketball and swimming). Topic models indeed model latent topics for semantic interpretability, but most assume a flat topic structure and ignore such semantic hierarchy. Given these two challenges, we propose a Hyperbolic Graph Topic Modeling Network to integrate both network hierarchy across linked documents and semantic hierarchy within texts into a unified HGNN framework. Specifically, we construct a two-layer document graph. Intra- and cross-layer encoding captures network hierarchy. We design a topic tree for text decoding to preserve semantic hierarchy and learn interpretable topics. Supervised and unsupervised experiments verify the effectiveness of our model.\n\n9: Robust Hierarchical Symbolic Explanations in Hyperbolic Space for Image Classification.

Our focus is on explaining deep discriminative models for images at multiple levels of abstraction, from fine-grained to fully abstract explanations. We use the natural properties of hyperbolic geometry to more efficiently model a hierarchical relationship of symbolic features with decreased distortion to generate robust hierarchical explanations. Specifically, we distill the underpinning knowledge in an image classifier by quantising the continuous latent space to form hyperbolic symbols and learn the relations between these symbols in a hierarchical manner to induce a knowledge tree.

Though Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing such graph hierarchy, they cannot model the rich textual semantics within documents. Moreover, text contents in documents usually discuss topics of different specificity. Hierarchical Topic Models (HTMs) discover such latent topic hierarchy within text corpora. However, most of them focus on the textual content within documents, and ignore the graph adjacency across interlinked documents. We thus propose a Hierarchical Graph Topic Modeling Transformer to integrate both topic hierarchy within documents and graph hierarchy across documents into a unified Transformer. Specifically, to incorporate topic hierarchy within documents, we design a topic tree and infer a hierarchical tree embedding for hierarchical topic modeling. To preserve both topic and graph hierarchies, we design our model in hyperbolic space and propose Hyperbolic Doubly Recurrent Neural Network, which models ancestral and fraternal tree structure. Both hierarchies are inserted into each Transformer layer to learn unified representations. Both supervised and unsupervised experiments verify the effectiveness of our model.\n\n11: HyperED: A hierarchy\u2010aware network based on\u00a0hyperbolic geometry for event detection.

International Conference on Climate Informatics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: Event detection plays an essential role in the task of event extraction. It aims at identifying event trigger words in a sentence and classifying event types. Generally, multiple event types are usually well\u2010organized with a hierarchical structure in real\u2010world scenarios, and hierarchical correlations between event types can be used to enhance event detection performance. However, such kind of hierarchical information has received insufficient attention which can lead to misclassification between multiple event types. In addition, the most existing methods perform event detection in Euclidean space, which cannot adequately represent hierarchical relationships. To address these issues, we propose a novel event detection network HyperED which embeds the event context and types in Poincar\u00e9 ball of hyperbolic geometry to help learn hierarchical features between events. Specifically, for the event detection context, we first leverage the pre\u2010trained BERT or BiLSTM in Euclidean space to learn the semantic features of ED sentences. Meanwhile, to make full use of the dependency knowledge, a GNN\u2010based model is applied when encoding event types to learn the correlations between events. Then we use a simple neural\u2010based transformation to project the embeddings into the Poincar\u00e9 ball to capture hierarchical features, and a distance score in hyperbolic space is computed for prediction. The experiments on MAVEN and ACE 2005 datasets indicate the effectiveness of the HyperED model and prove the natural advantages of hyperbolic spaces in expressing hierarchies in an intuitive way.\n\n12: Scalable and Effective Temporal Graph Representation Learning With Hyperbolic Geometry..

IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 2\nAbstract: Real-life graphs often exhibit intricate dynamics that evolve continuously over time. To effectively represent continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs), various temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been developed to model their dynamics and topological structures in Euclidean space. Despite their notable achievements, the performance of Euclidean-based TGNNs is limited and bounded by the representation capabilities of Euclidean geometry, particularly for complex graphs with hierarchical and power-law structures. This is because Euclidean space does not have enough room (its volume grows polynomially with respect to radius) to learn hierarchical structures that expand exponentially. As a result, this leads to high-distortion embeddings and suboptimal temporal graph representations. To break the limitations and enhance the representation capabilities of TGNNs, in this article, we propose a scalable and effective TGNN with hyperbolic geometries for CTDG representation (called STGNh ). It captures evolving behaviors and stores hierarchical structures simultaneously by integrating a memory-based module and a structure-based module into a unified framework, which can scale to billion-scale graphs. Concretely, a simple hyperbolic update gate (HuG) is designed as the memory-based module to store temporal dynamics efficiently; for the structure-based module, we propose an effective hyperbolic temporal Transformer (HyT) model to capture complex graph structures and generate up-to-date node embeddings. Extensive experimental results on a variety of medium-scale and billion-scale graphs demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STGNh for CTDG representation, as it significantly outperforms baselines in various downstream tasks.\n\n13: Brep2Seq: a dataset and hierarchical deep learning network for reconstruction and generation of computer-aided design models.

Recently, there has been considerable research interest in deep model generation due to the increasing potential of deep learning methods. To address the challenges of 3D reconstruction and generation, we propose Brep2Seq, a novel deep neural network designed to transform the B-rep model into a sequence of editable parametrized feature-based modeling operations comprising principal primitives and detailed features. Brep2Seq employs an encoder-decoder architecture based on the Transformer, leveraging geometry and topological information within B-rep models to extract the feature representation of the original 3D shape. Due to its hierarchical network architecture and training strategy, Brep2Seq achieved improved model reconstruction and controllable model generation by distinguishing between the primary shape and detailed features of CAD models. To train Brep2Seq, a large-scale dataset comprising one million CAD designs is established through an automatic geometry synthesis method. Extensive experiments on both DeepCAD and Fusion 360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Brep2Seq, and show its applicability to simple mechanical components in real-world scenarios. We further apply Brep2Seq to various downstream applications, including point cloud reconstruction, model interpolation, shape constraint generation and CAD feature recognition.\n\n14: Hyperbolic geometry-based deep learning methods to produce population trees from genotype data.

Typically, these trees are produced using standard methods like hierarchical clustering, neighbor joining, or maximum likelihood. However, such methods are non-parametric: they require all data to be present at the time of tree formation, and the addition of new data points necessitates the regeneration of the entire tree, a potentially expensive process. They also do not easily integrate with larger workflows. In this study, we aim to address these problems by introducing parametric deep learning methods for tree formation from genotype data. Our models specifically create continuous representations of population trees in hyperbolic space, which has previously proven highly effective in embedding hierarchically structured data. We present two different architectures - a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a variational autoencoder (VAE) - and we analyze their performance using a variety of metrics along with comparisons to established tree-building methods. Both models tested produce embedding spaces that reflect human evolutionary history. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of these models by verifying that addition of new samples to an existing tree occurs in a semantically meaningful manner. Finally, we use Dasgupta\u2019s Cost to compare the quality of trees generated by our models to those produced by established methods. Despite the fact that the benchmark methods are directly fit on the evaluation data, our models are able to outperform some of these and achieve highly comparable performance overall. Author summary Tree production is a vital task in population genetics, but current approaches fall prey to several common shortfalls. Most notably, they lack the ability to add new data points after tree generation, and they are often difficult to use in larger pipelines. By leveraging cutting-edge advances pairing deep learning with hyperbolic geometry, we develop multiple models designed to rectify these issues. Through experiments on a dataset of humans from globally widespread ancestries, we demonstrate the generalizability of our models to new data, and we also show strong empirical performance with respect to currently used methods. In addition, we show that the data representations produced by our models are semantically meaningful and reflect known facts about human evolutionary history. Finally, we discuss the additional benefits our models could provide, including improved visualization, greater privacy preservation, and improved integration with downstream machine learning tasks. In conclusion, we present models that are accurate, flexible, and generalizable, with the potential to facilitate a variety of further applications.\n\n15: HyperSDFusion: Bridging Hierarchical Structures in Language and Geometry for Enhanced 3D Text2Shape Generation.

The text-shape pairs exhibit a hierarchical structure, where a general text like \u201cchair\u201d covers all 3D shapes of the chair, while more detailed prompts refer to more specific shapes. Furthermore, both text and 3D shapes are inherently hierarchical structures. However, existing Text2Shape methods, such as SDFusion, do not exploit that. In this work, we propose HyperSD-Fusion, a dual-branch diffusion model that generates 3D shapes from a given text. Since hyperbolic space is suitable for handling hierarchical data, we propose to learn the hierarchical representations of text and 3D shapes in hyperbolic space. First, we introduce a hyperbolic text-image encoder to learn the sequential and multi-modal hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In addition, we design a hyperbolic text-graph convolution module to learn the hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In order to fully utilize these text features, we introduce a dual-branch structure to embed text features in 3D feature space. At last, to endow the generated 3D shapes with a hierarchical structure, we devise a hyperbolic hierarchical loss. Our method is the first to explore the hyperbolic hierarchical representation for text-to-shape generation. Experimental results on the existing text-to-shape paired dataset, Text2Shape, achieved state-of-the-art results. We release our implementation under HyperSDFusion.github.io.\n\n16: Hyperbolic Geometry in Computer Vision: A Survey.

To address these issues, we propose to conduct rare skin disease diagnosis in hyperbolic space, which facilitates implicit class hierarchical structures and precise uncertainty measurement due to pivotal geometrical properties. We propose a Hyperbolic Geometry-driven Robustness Enhancement (HGRE) framework specifically tailored for diagnosing rare skin diseases. The HGRE framework uses implicit hierarchical relation in the hyperbolic space to better represent the features of rare diseases. Moreover, the framework incorporates an Adversarial Proxy Construction (APC) module to address the problem of data uncertainty. Specifically, the APC module uses the distance to the hyperbolic space origin as an indicator of uncertainty to filter and construct adversarial proxies for each uncertain prototype to achieve adversarial robust training. Leveraging the two unique geometrical properties, our HGRE framework effectively addresses the limitations of insufficient hierarchical relation utilization and data uncertainty in FSL-based rare skin disease diagnosis. This enhancement of the model's robustness in training has been corroborated by extensive empirical validation on two skin lesion datasets, where HGRE's performance notably surpassed existing state-of-the-art FSL methods.\n\n18: Learning Continuous Hierarchies in the Lorentz Model of Hyperbolic Geometry.

International Conference on Machine Learning, 2018.\nNumber of citations: 432\nAbstract: We are concerned with the discovery of hierarchical relationships from large-scale unstructured similarity scores. For this purpose, we study different models of hyperbolic space and find that learning embeddings in the Lorentz model is substantially more efficient than in the Poincar\\'e-ball model. We show that the proposed approach allows us to learn high-quality embeddings of large taxonomies which yield improvements over Poincar\\'e embeddings, especially in low dimensions. Lastly, we apply our model to discover hierarchies in two real-world datasets: we show that an embedding in hyperbolic space can reveal important aspects of a company's organizational structure as well as reveal historical relationships between language families.\n\n19: Geometric Inference in Bayesian Hierarchical Models with Applications to Topic Modeling.

Given the striking success of these approaches, we extend the famous hyperbolic geometric random graph models of Krioukov et al. to arbitrary dimension, providing a detailed analysis of the degree distribution behavior of the model in an expanded portion of the parameter space, considering several regimes which have yet to be considered. Our analysis includes a study of the asymptotic correlations of degree in the network, revealing a non-trivial dependence on the dimension and power law exponent. These results pave the way to using hyperbolic geometric random graph models in high dimensional contexts, which may provide a new window into the internal states of network nodes, manifested only by their external interconnectivity.\n\n21: Modeling Scale-free Graphs with Hyperbolic Geometry for Knowledge-aware Recommendation.

Web Search and Data Mining, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 73\nAbstract: Aiming to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of tradi- tional recommender systems, incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary information has recently gained considerable attention. Via unifying the KG with user-item interactions into a tripartite graph, recent works explore the graph topologies to learn the low-dimensional representations of users and items with rich semantics. These real-world tripartite graphs are usually scale-free, however, the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures of which are underemphasized in existing works, consequently, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue and provide more accurate recommendation, we propose a knowledge-aware recommendation method with Lorentz model of the hyperbolic geometry, namely Lorentzian Knowledge-enhanced Graph convolutional networks for Recommendation (LKGR). LKGR facilitates better modeling of scale-free tripartite graphs after the data unification. Specifically, we employ different information propagation strategies in the hyperbolic space to explicitly encode heterogeneous information from historical interactions and KGs. Additionally, our proposed knowledge-aware attention mechanism enables the model to automatically measure the information contribution, producing the coherent information aggregation in the hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LKGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.6-15.3% of Recall@20 on Top-K recommendation.\n\n22: Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion.

International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) represent a crucial source of structured temporal information and exhibit significant utility in various real-world applications. However, TKGs are susceptible to incompleteness, necessitating Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) to predict missing facts. Existing models have encountered limitations in effectively capturing the intricate temporal dynamics and hierarchical relations within TKGs. To address these challenges, HyGNet is proposed, leveraging hyperbolic geometry to effectively model temporal knowledge graphs. The model comprises two components: the Hyperbolic Gated Graph Neural Network (HGGNN) and the Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN). HGGNN aggregates neighborhood information in hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the contextual information and dependencies between entities. HCNN interacts with embeddings in hyperbolic space, effectively modeling the complex interactions between entities, relations, and timestamps. Additionally, a consistency loss is introduced to ensure smooth transitions in temporal embeddings. The extensive experimental results conducted on four benchmark datasets for TKGC highlight the effectiveness of HyGNet. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison to previous models, showcasing its potential for real-world applications that involve temporal reasoning and knowledge prediction.\n\n23: Discrete-time Temporal Network Embedding via Implicit Hierarchical Learning in Hyperbolic Space.

Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 116\nAbstract: Representation learning over temporal networks has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Efforts are mainly focused on modeling structural dependencies and temporal evolving regularities in Euclidean space which, however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To explore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. More specially, HTGN maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and incorporates hyperbolic graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network, to capture the evolving behaviors and implicitly preserve hierarchical information simultaneously. Furthermore, in the hyperbolic space, we propose two important modules that enable HTGN to successfully model temporal networks: (1) hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention (HTA) module to attend to historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency (HTC) module to ensure stability and generalization. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTGN for temporal graph embedding, as it consistently outperforms competing methods by significant margins in various temporal link prediction tasks. Specifically, HTGN achieves AUC improvement up to 9.98% for link prediction and 11.4% for new link prediction. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the representational ability of hyperbolic geometry and the effectiveness of the proposed HTA and HTC modules.\n\n24: Extracting Event Temporal Relations via Hyperbolic Geometry.

Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 21\nAbstract: Detecting events and their evolution through time is a crucial task in natural language understanding. Recent neural approaches to event temporal relation extraction typically map events to embeddings in the Euclidean space and train a classifier to detect temporal relations between event pairs. However, embeddings in the Euclidean space cannot capture richer asymmetric relations such as event temporal relations. We thus propose to embed events into hyperbolic spaces, which are intrinsically oriented at modeling hierarchical structures. We introduce two approaches to encode events and their temporal relations in hyperbolic spaces. One approach leverages hyperbolic embeddings to directly infer event relations through simple geometrical operations. In the second one, we devise an end-to-end architecture composed of hyperbolic neural units tailored for the temporal relation extraction task. Thorough experimental assessments on widely used datasets have shown the benefits of revisiting the tasks on a different geometrical space, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several standard metrics. Finally, the ablation study and several qualitative analyses highlighted the rich event semantics implicitly encoded into hyperbolic spaces.\n\n25: Hyperbolic Metric Learning for Visual Outlier Detection.

However, the inherent hierarchical concept structure of visual data, which is instrumental to OOD detection, is often poorly captured by conventional methods based on Euclidean geometry. This work proposes a metric framework that leverages the strengths of Hyperbolic geometry for OOD detection. Inspired by previous works that refine the decision boundary for OOD data with synthetic outliers, we extend this method to Hyperbolic space. Interestingly, we find that synthetic outliers do not benefit OOD detection in Hyperbolic space as they do in Euclidean space. Furthermore we explore the relationship between OOD detection performance and Hyperbolic embedding dimension, addressing practical concerns in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments show that our framework improves the FPR95 for OOD detection from 22\\% to 15\\% and from 49% to 28% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively compared to Euclidean methods.\n\n26: HyperText: Endowing FastText with Hyperbolic Geometry.

FastText, as the state-of-the-art text classifier based on shallow neural network in Euclidean space, may not represent such hierarchies precisely with limited representation capacity. Considering that hyperbolic space is naturally suitable for modelling tree-like hierarchical data, we propose a new model named HyperText for efficient text classification by endowing FastText with hyperbolic geometry. Empirically, we show that HyperText outperforms FastText on a range of text classification tasks with much reduced parameters.\n\n27: Hyp2Nav: Hyperbolic Planning and Curiosity for Crowd Navigation.

Effective crowd navigation requires not only safe yet fast planning, but should also enable interpretability and computational efficiency for working in real-time on embedded devices. In this work, we advocate for hyperbolic learning to enable crowd navigation and we introduce Hyp2Nav. Different from conventional reinforcement learning-based crowd navigation methods, Hyp2Nav leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic geometry to better encode the hierarchical nature of decision-making processes in navigation tasks. We propose a hyperbolic policy model and a hyperbolic curiosity module that results in effective social navigation, best success rates, and returns across multiple simulation settings, using up to 6 times fewer parameters than competitor state-of-the-art models. With our approach, it becomes even possible to obtain policies that work in 2-dimensional embedding spaces, opening up new possibilities for low-resource crowd navigation and model interpretability. Insightfully, the internal hyperbolic representation of Hyp2Nav correlates with how much attention the robot pays to the surrounding crowds, e.g. due to multiple people occluding its pathway or to a few of them showing colliding plans, rather than to its own planned route.

Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal input of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging. Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are reduced by 78.12\\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\\%. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current major methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.\n\n29: Hyperbolic Geometric Graph Representation Learning for Hierarchy-imbalance Node Classification.

The Web Conference, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 21\nAbstract: Learning unbiased node representations for imbalanced samples in the graph has become a more remarkable and important topic. For the graph, a significant challenge is that the topological properties of the nodes (e.g., locations, roles) are unbalanced (topology-imbalance), other than the number of training labeled nodes (quantity-imbalance). Existing studies on topology-imbalance focus on the location or the local neighborhood structure of nodes, ignoring the global underlying hierarchical properties of the graph, i.e., hierarchy. In the real-world scenario, the hierarchical structure of graph data reveals important topological properties of graphs and is relevant to a wide range of applications. We find that training labeled nodes with different hierarchical properties have a significant impact on the node classification tasks and confirm it in our experiments. It is well known that hyperbolic geometry has a unique advantage in representing the hierarchical structure of graphs. Therefore, we attempt to explore the hierarchy-imbalance issue for node classification of graph neural networks with a novelty perspective of hyperbolic geometry, including its characteristics and causes. Then, we propose a novel hyperbolic geometric hierarchy-imbalance learning framework, named HyperIMBA, to alleviate the hierarchy-imbalance issue caused by uneven hierarchy-levels and cross-hierarchy connectivity patterns of labeled nodes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of HyperIMBA for hierarchy-imbalance node classification tasks.\n\n30: AdaPT: A Set of Guidelines for Hyperbolic Multimodal Multilingual NLP.

However, many data types inherently possess complex geometries, and model training methods involve operating over their latent representations, which cannot be effectively captured in the Euclidean space. The hyperbolic space provides a more generalized representative geometry to model the hierarchical complexities of the tree-like structure of natural language. We propose A DA PT a set of guidelines for initialization, parametrization, and training of neural networks, which adapts to the dataset and can be used with different manifolds. A DA PT can be generalized over any existing neural network training methodology and leads to more stable training without a substantial increase in training time. We apply A DA PT guidelines over two state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on three tasks over 12 languages across speech and text. Through extensive qualitative analysis, we put forward the applicability of A DA PT as a set of guidelines optimally utilizing the manifold geometry, which can be extended to various downstream tasks across languages and modalities.\n\n31: On Probabilistic Pullback Metrics on Latent Hyperbolic Manifolds.

Recent advances show that using Riemannian manifolds as latent spaces provides more flexibility to learn higher quality embeddings. This paper focuses on the hyperbolic manifold, a particularly suitable choice for modeling hierarchical relationships. Previous approaches relying on hyperbolic geodesics for interpolating the latent space often generate paths crossing low-data regions, leading to highly uncertain predictions. Instead, we propose augmenting the hyperbolic metric with a pullback metric to account for distortions introduced by the LVM's nonlinear mapping and provide a complete development for pullback metrics of Gaussian Process LVMs (GPLVMs). Our experiments demonstrate that geodesics on the pullback metric not only respect the geometry of the hyperbolic latent space but also align with the underlying data distribution, significantly reducing uncertainty in predictions.\n\n32: Preserving Hidden Hierarchical Structure: Poincar\u00e9 Distance for Enhanced Genomic Sequence Analysis.

Although it has proven beneficial to sequence analysis, machine learning (ML) is not without its difficulties, particularly when the feature space becomes highly dimensional. While most ML models operate with the conventional Euclidean distance, the hidden hierarchical structure present among a set of phylogenetically related sequences is difficult to represent in Euclidean space without losing much information or requiring many dimensions. Since such hierarchical structure can be informative to analysis tasks such as clustering and classification, we propose two measures for generating a distance matrix from a set of sequences based on distance in the Poincar\u00e9 disk model of hyperbolic geometry, or the Poincar\u00e9 distance, for short. Such a distance measure can allow to embedding of even a fully resolved phylogenetic tree in just two dimensions with minimal distortion to any hierarchical structure. Our first approach is based purely on the classical Poincar\u00e9 distance, while the other approach modifies this distance by combining the Euclidean norms and the dot product between the sequence representations. A thorough analysis of both measures demonstrates its superiority in a variety of genomic and proteomic sequence classification tasks in terms of efficiency, accuracy, predictive performance, and the capacity to capture significant sequence correlations. These approaches perform better than existing state-of-the-art methods across the majority of evaluation metrics.\n\n33: Hyperbolic Representation Learning: Revisiting and Advancing.

International Conference on Machine Learning, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 18\nAbstract: The non-Euclidean geometry of hyperbolic spaces has recently garnered considerable attention in the realm of representation learning. Current endeavors in hyperbolic representation largely presuppose that the underlying hierarchies can be automatically inferred and preserved through the adaptive optimization process. This assumption, however, is questionable and requires further validation. In this work, we first introduce a position-tracking mechanism to scrutinize existing prevalent \\hlms, revealing that the learned representations are sub-optimal and unsatisfactory. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, hyperbolic informed embedding (HIE), by incorporating cost-free hierarchical information deduced from the hyperbolic distance of the node to origin (i.e., induced hyperbolic norm) to advance existing \\hlms. The proposed method HIE is both task-agnostic and model-agnostic, enabling its seamless integration with a broad spectrum of models and tasks. Extensive experiments across various models and different tasks demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method. Remarkably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of up to 21.4\\% compared to the competing baselines.\n\n34: Multi-Behavior Recommendation with Hyperbolic Geometry.

To alleviate the problem, recent works on multi-behavior recommendation incorporated multiple types of user-item interactions such as click, add-to-cart, and buy. However, the latest approaches are still limited by overlooking early-stage interactions, and have limited expressiveness of Euclidean geometry. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a Multi-behavior Hyperbolic Graph Recommender (MB-HGR) with two novel aspects. First, it uses multiple heterogeneous graphs to learn multiple user behavior types, where each heterogeneous graph represents a user-item interaction type. This will help not only alleviate the serious data sparsity problem, but also allow the model to explicitly weight different behavior types and prevent information loss. Second, it leverages the expressiveness of the hyperbolic geometry over Euclidean geometry, where exponential growth of distances in the hyperbolic geometry matches the exponential growth of nodes in the hierarchical structures and learns better users/items representations. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets show that on average our proposed model achieves a significant improvement of 28.32% at Recall@10 and 30.14% at NDCG@10 over the best baseline.\n\n35: Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Hierarchical 3D Point Cloud Embedding.

Although hyperbolic geometries have been proven effective for language-image pre-training, their capabilities to unify language, image, and 3D Point Cloud modalities are under-explored. We extend the 3D Point Cloud modality in hyperbolic multi-modal contrastive pre-training. Additionally, we explore the entailment, modality gap, and alignment regularizers for learning hierarchical 3D embeddings and facilitating the transfer of knowledge from both Text and Image modalities. These regularizers enable the learning of intra-modal hierarchy within each modality and inter-modal hierarchy across text, 2D images, and 3D Point Clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed training strategy yields an outstanding 3D Point Cloud encoder, and the obtained 3D Point Cloud hierarchical embeddings significantly improve performance on various downstream tasks.\n\n36: Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks: A Tutorial on Methods and Applications.

Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 10\nAbstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) generalize conventional neural networks to graph-structured data and have received considerable attention owing to their impressive performance. In spite of the notable successes, the performance of Euclidean models is inherently bounded and limited by the representation ability of Euclidean geometry, especially when it comes to datasets with highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy. Recently, hyperbolic spaces have emerged as a promising alternative for processing graph data with tree-like structure or power-law distribution and a surge of works on either methods or novel applications have been seen. Unlike Euclidean space, which expands polynomially, hyperbolic space grows exponentially with its radius, making it more suitable for modeling complex real-world data. Hence, it gains natural advantages in abstracting tree-like graphs with a hierarchical organization or power-law distribution. To support the burgeoning interest in Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), the primary goal of this tutorial is to give a systematical review of the methods, applications, and challenges in this fast-growing and vibrant area, with the express purpose of being accessible to all audiences.More specifically, we will first give a brief introduction to graph neural networks as well as some preliminary of Riemannian manifold and hyperbolic geometry. We then will comprehensively revisit the technical details of the developed HGNNs, by unifying them into a general framework and summarizing the variants of each component. Besides, we will introduce applications deployed in a variety of fields. Finally, we will discuss several challenges and present the potential solutions to address them, including some initial attempts of our own, which potentially paves the path for the further flourishing of the research community.\n\n37: Hyperbolic Music Transformer for Structured Music Generation.

IEEE Access, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 8\nAbstract: In the field of music generation, generating structured music is a highly challenging research topic. Music generation methods are currently learned in Euclidean space and usually modeled as a time series without structural properties, but due to the limitations of the time series representation in Euclidean space, the hierarchical structure of music is difficult to learn, and the generated music is poorly structured. Therefore, based on hyperbolic theory, this paper proposes a Hyperbolic Music Transformer model, which considers the hierarchy in music and models the structured components of music in hyperbolic space. Meanwhile, in order for the network to have sufficient capacity to learn music data with hierarchical and power regular structure, a hyperbolic attention mechanism is proposed, which is an extension of the attention mechanism in hyperbolic space based on the definition of hyperboloid and Klein model. Subjective and objective experiments show that the model proposed in this paper is able to generate high-quality music with structure.\n\n38: Hyperbolic Procrustes Analysis Using Riemannian Geometry.

Due to the constant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and captures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic embeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many real-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree networks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not ubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To address this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex hyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation learning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically structured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The unit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity to capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the hyperbolic embedding models significantly. We also explore the competence of complex hyperbolic geometry on the multitree structure and $1$-$N$ structure.\n\n40: Hyperbolic Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction in Low Dimensions.

Recently, some Euclidean KGE methods have been enhanced to model semantic hierarchies commonly found in KGs, improving the performance of link prediction. To embed hierarchical data, hyperbolic space has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Euclidean space, offering high fidelity and lower memory consumption. Unlike Euclidean, hyperbolic space provides countless curvatures to choose from. However, it is difficult for existing hyperbolic KGE methods to obtain the optimal curvature settings manually, thereby limiting their ability to effectively model semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel KGE model called $\\textbf{Hyp}$erbolic $\\textbf{H}$ierarchical $\\textbf{KGE}$ (HypHKGE). This model introduces attention-based learnable curvatures for hyperbolic space, which helps preserve rich semantic hierarchies. Furthermore, to utilize the preserved hierarchies for inferring missing links, we define hyperbolic hierarchical transformations based on the theory of hyperbolic geometry, including both inter-level and intra-level modeling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HypHKGE model on the three benchmark datasets (WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10).

In this paper, we extend our earlier work, that showed how to use regularizers in the hyperbolic space to improve performance of point cloud classification models, to the problem of part segmentation. This requires careful modeling of the hierarchical relationships between parts and whole point cloud to properly control the hyperbolic geometry of the feature space produced by the neural network. We show how the proposed method improves the performance of commonly used neural network architectures, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the part segmentation task.\n\n42: Hyperbolic Entailment Cones for Learning Hierarchical Embeddings.

Second, we view hierarchical relations as partial orders defined using a family of nested geodesically convex cones. We prove that these entailment cones admit an optimal shape with a closed form expression both in the Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces.

Despite the impressive performance of various hyperbolic neural networks across numerous domains, research on adapting the Transformer to hyperbolic space remains limited. Previous attempts have mainly focused on modifying self-attention modules in the Transformer. However, these efforts have fallen short of developing a complete hyperbolic Transformer. This stems primarily from: (i) the absence of well-defined modules in hyperbolic space, including linear transformation layers, LayerNorm layers, activation functions, dropout operations, etc. (ii) the quadratic time complexity of the existing hyperbolic self-attention module w.r.t the number of input tokens, which hinders its scalability. To address these challenges, we propose, Hypformer, a novel hyperbolic Transformer based on the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry. In Hypformer, we introduce two foundational blocks that define the essential modules of the Transformer in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we develop a linear self-attention mechanism in hyperbolic space, enabling hyperbolic Transformer to process billion-scale graph data and long-sequence inputs for the first time. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Hypformer across various datasets, demonstrating its potential as an effective and scalable solution for large-scale data representation and large models.\n\n44: Review-Based Hyperbolic Cross-Domain Recommendation.

In response to this, algorithms that leverage side information such as review texts have been proposed. Furthermore, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR), which captures domain-shareable knowledge and transfers it from a richer domain (source) to a sparser one (target), has received notable attention. Nevertheless, the majority of existing methodologies assume a Euclidean embedding space, encountering difficulties in accurately representing richer text information and managing complex interactions between users and items. This paper advocates a hyperbolic CDR approach based on review texts for modeling user-item relationships. We first emphasize that conventional distance-based domain alignment techniques may cause problems because small modifications in hyperbolic geometry result in magnified perturbations, ultimately leading to the collapse of hierarchical structures. To address this challenge, we propose hierarchy-aware embedding and domain alignment schemes that adjust the scale to extract domain-shareable information without disrupting structural forms. The process involves the initial embedding of review texts in hyperbolic space, followed by feature extraction incorporating degree-based normalization and structure alignment. We conducted extensive experiments to substantiate the efficiency, robustness, and scalability of our proposed model in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n45: Hyperbolic Space-Based Autoencoder for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection.

However, current DL-based methods lack an effective means of regularizing the background information. In this article, the hyperbolic space-based autoencoder (HSAE) is proposed for the hyperspectral anomaly detection task. We assume that an effective hierarchical structural representation can better model the HSI in the spatial domain, and this enables the background information to be effectively regularized. Motivated by this idea, the HSAE embeds the HSI into hyperbolic space, which is a non-Euclidean geometry with a constant negative curvature and an exponential growth distance between points. Using a wrapped normal prior distribution, the training of the hidden representation is supervised to preserve more hierarchical features. After the training process, a hyperbolic distance-based anomaly detector (HDB) is introduced to discover anomalies in a more robust way. Experimental results on several popular HSI benchmarks fully demonstrate the superiority of our HSAE.\n\n46: Fast generation of dynamic complex networks with underlying hyperbolic geometry.

However, as in general GCNs, over-smoothing may occur as the number of model layers increases, limiting the representation capabilities of most current HGCN models. In this paper, we propose residual hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (R-HGCNs) to address the over-smoothing problem. We introduce a hyperbolic residual connection function to overcome the over-smoothing problem, and also theoretically prove the effectiveness of the hyperbolic residual function. Moreover, we use product manifolds and HyperDrop to facilitate the R-HGCNs. The distinctive features of the R-HGCNs are as follows: (1) The hyperbolic residual connection preserves the initial node information in each layer and adds a hyperbolic identity mapping to prevent node features from being indistinguishable. (2) Product manifolds in R-HGCNs have been set up with different origin points in different components to facilitate the extraction of feature information from a wider range of perspectives, which enhances the representing capability of R-HGCNs. (3) HyperDrop adds multiplicative Gaussian noise into hyperbolic representations, such that perturbations can be added to alleviate the over-fitting problem without deconstructing the hyperbolic geometry.\nExperiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of R-HGCNs under various graph convolution layers and different structures of product manifolds.\n\n48: A Fashion Item Recommendation Model in Hyperbolic Space.

Our experiments on three data sets show that our model performs better than previous models trained in Euclidean space only, confirming the effectiveness of our model. Our ablation studies show that multi-task learning plays a key role, and removing the Euclidean loss substantially deteriorates the model performance.\n\n49: Toward a Manifold-Preserving Temporal Graph Network in Hyperbolic Space.

Utilizing hyperbolic geometry for learning dynamic graph representation has gained a growing interest in recent years. However, the majority of hyperbolic-based approaches rely on tangent spaces to perform graph operations, which could distort the structure of the dynamic graph when the graph grows over time. To avoid the distortion in tangent space, we propose a Hyperbolic Manifold-Preserving Temporal Graph Network that works directly on the hyperbolic manifold. The model includes a graph convolution module for learning the spatial dependencies, an attention architecture for capturing the temporal properties, and a gated recurrent unit for extracting the spatio-temporal relationships. By evaluating on diverse real-world dynamic graphs, our model has achieved significant improvements in link prediction and new link prediction tasks, in comparison with other baselines.\n\n50: Poincare\u0301 disc models in hyperbolic geometry.

IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 21\nAbstract: Temporal networks arise in various real-world scenarios, including social networks, user-item networks, traffic networks, financial transaction networks, etc. Modeling the dynamics of temporal networks is of importance as it describes how the networks evolve, which helps to understand and predict the behavior of the systems. There has been a lot of research on temporal network representation learning so far. Nonetheless, most of them are based on euclidean geometry, which fails to encode the underlying hierarchical layout or scale-free property of the real-world temporal network. Encouragingly, hyperbolic geometry excels in preserving both node similarity and network hierarchies. In the preliminary work, we proposed a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) on the Poincar\u00e9 ball model, taking advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. HTGN moves the temporal network embedding into hyperbolic space and employs the hyperbolic graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network to capture spatial and temporal dynamics, respectively. In addition, two modules were further put forward to advance the performance: (1) hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention to watch historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency to enforce the embeddings changing gradually. In this work, we further design a lightweight and efficient hyperbolic graph convolutional module that enables HTGN to scale to large-size graphs easily and flexibly handle datasets with different densities. Moreover, we investigate the hyperbolic temporal network embedding in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry with regard to its numerical stability and optimization advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposals as they consistently outperform the competing baselines on small-, medium-, and large-scale datasets.\n\n52: Shedding Light on Problems with Hyperbolic Graph Learning.

The asserted benefits are improved performance on a variety of graph tasks, node classification and link prediction included. Claims have also been made about the geometric suitability of particular hierarchical graph datasets to representation in hyperbolic space. Despite these claims, our work makes a surprising discovery: when simple Euclidean models with comparable numbers of parameters are properly trained in the same environment, in most cases, they perform as well, if not better, than all introduced hyperbolic graph representation learning models, even on graph datasets previously claimed to be the most hyperbolic as measured by Gromov $\\delta$-hyperbolicity (i.e., perfect trees). This observation gives rise to a simple question: how can this be? We answer this question by taking a careful look at the field of hyperbolic graph representation learning as it stands today, and find that a number of results do not diligently present baselines, make faulty modelling assumptions when constructing algorithms, and use misleading metrics to quantify geometry of graph datasets. We take a closer look at each of these three problems, elucidate the issues, perform an analysis of methods, and introduce a parametric family of benchmark datasets to ascertain the applicability of (hyperbolic) graph neural networks.\n\n53: Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning.

As such, a wide variety of self-supervised learning approaches have been proposed. Among them, contrastive learning has shown competitive performance on several benchmark datasets. The embeddings of contrastive learning are arranged on a hypersphere that results in using the inner (dot) product as a distance measurement in Euclidean space. However, the underlying structure of many scientific fields like social networks, brain imaging, and computer graphics data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent geometry. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn semantic relationships in the hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space is a continuous version of trees that naturally owns the ability to model hierarchical structures and is thus beneficial for efficient contrastive representation learning. We also extend the proposed Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning (HCL) to the supervised domain and studied the adversarial robustness of HCL. The comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves better results on self-supervised pretraining, supervised classification, and higher robust accuracy than baseline methods.\n\n54: HGWaveNet: A Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network for Temporal Link Prediction.

However, existing methods are mainly built upon uniform Euclidean space, which has been found to be conflict with the power-law distributions of real-world graphs and unable to represent the hierarchical connections between nodes effectively. With respect to the special data characteristic, hyperbolic geometry offers an ideal alternative due to its exponential expansion property. In this paper, we propose HGWaveNet, a novel hyperbolic graph neural network that fully exploits the fitness between hyperbolic spaces and data distributions for temporal link prediction. Specifically, we design two key modules to learn the spatial topological structures and temporal evolutionary information separately. On the one hand, a hyperbolic diffusion graph convolution (HDGC) module effectively aggregates information from a wider range of neighbors. On the other hand, the internal order of causal correlation between historical states is captured by hyperbolic dilated causal convolution (HDCC) modules. The whole model is built upon the hyperbolic spaces to preserve the hierarchical structural information in the entire data flow. To prove the superiority of HGWaveNet, extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world graph datasets and the results show a relative improvement by up to 6.67% on AUC for temporal link prediction over SOTA methods.\n\n55: Hyperbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Sequential decision-making requires reasoning about the possible future consequences of current behavior. Consequently, capturing the relationship between key evolving features for a given task is conducive to recovering effective policies. To this end, hyperbolic geometry provides deep RL models with a natural basis to precisely encode this inherently hierarchical information. However, applying existing methodologies from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal optimization instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance characterizing RL gradient estimators. Hence, we design a new general method that counteracts such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end learning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our framework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on the Procgen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and generalization benefits. Given its natural fit, we hope future RL research will consider hyperbolic representations as a standard tool.\n\n56: Enhancing Hyperbolic Graph Embeddings via Contrastive Learning.

Many efforts have been made to design hyperbolic versions of neural network operations. However, the inspiring geometric properties of this unique geometry have not been fully explored yet. The potency of graph models powered by the hyperbolic space is still largely underestimated. Besides, the rich information carried by abundant unlabelled samples is also not well utilized. Inspired by the recently active and emerging self-supervised learning, in this study, we attempt to enhance the representation power of hyperbolic graph models by drawing upon the advantages of contrastive learning. More specifically, we put forward a novel Hyperbolic Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL) framework which learns node representations through multiple hyperbolic spaces to implicitly capture the hierarchical structure shared between different views. Then, we design a hyperbolic position consistency (HPC) constraint based on hyperbolic distance and the homophily assumption to make contrastive learning fit into hyperbolic space. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HGCL as it consistently outperforms competing methods by considerable margins for the node classification task.\n\n57: The hidden hyperbolic geometry of international trade: World Trade Atlas 1870\u20132013.

Trade distances, based on a gravity model predicting the existence of significant trade channels, are such that the closer countries are in trade space, the greater their chance of becoming connected. The atlas provides us with information regarding the long-term evolution of the international trade system and demonstrates that, in terms of trade, the world is not flat but hyperbolic, as a reflection of its complex architecture. The departure from flatness has been increasing since World War I, meaning that differences in trade distances are growing and trade networks are becoming more hierarchical. Smaller-scale economies are moving away from other countries except for the largest economies; meanwhile those large economies are increasing their chances of becoming connected worldwide. At the same time, Preferential Trade Agreements do not fit in perfectly with natural communities within the trade space and have not necessarily reduced internal trade barriers. We discuss an interpretation in terms of globalization, hierarchization, and localization; three simultaneous forces that shape the international trade system.\n\n58: Geometry Interaction Embeddings for Interpolation Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a cornerstone for structuring vast amounts of information, enabling sophisticated AI applications across domains. The progression to temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) introduces time as an essential dimension, allowing for a dynamic representation of entity relationships. Despite their potential, TKGs often suffer from incompleteness, necessitating the development of temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) techniques. These methods, particularly focusing on interpolation within the known timeframe, aim to infer missing temporal facts and enhance the predictive capabilities of TKGs. The prevalent reliance on Euclidean space modeling in TKGC methods presents challenges in capturing the complex, hierarchical, and time-varying nature of TKGs. To overcome these limitations, we introduced the attention-based geometry interaction embedding (ATGIE) method, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of multiple geometric spaces, i.e., Euclidean, hyperbolic, and hypersphere, to model the intricacies of TKGs more effectively. ATGIE employs an attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the contributions of different geometric spaces, allowing it to adaptively form reliable spatial structures based on interactive geometric information. This multi-space modeling not only captures the diverse relationships within TKGs but also facilitates a nuanced understanding of how entities and their relationships evolve over time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate ATGIE\u2019s superiority in TKGC tasks, showcasing its improvement over existing methods, robustness to noise, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. The results highlight ATGIE\u2019s potential to advance the state-of-the-art in TKGC, offering a promising direction for research and application in the field.\n\n59: Fast hyperbolic mapping based on the hierarchical community structure in complex networks.

Addressing this problem, we present a novel fast hyperbolic mapping algorithm called hyperbolic mapping based on the hierarchical community structure (HMCS), which is based on the network evolution model, the community-sector model in hyperbolic space and the hierarchical community structure (HCS) of complex networks. We present an index called community closeness (CC) to measure the adjacency relationship between the communities. Then we propose a ranking algorithm for first-level and second-level communities based on CC to determine the order of communities on the hyperbolic disc and map the network into hyperbolic space based on the order and the angular range of the corresponding sector of the second-level communities. We find that HMCS greatly reduces the mapping time complexity and achieves linearity () in sparse networks under the premise of ensuring better mapping accuracy compared with existing hyperbolic mapping algorithms. Experiments show that the HMCS algorithm occupies a unique attractive position in the space of tradeoffs between mapping accuracy and computational complexity.\n\n60: Hyperbolic Function Embedding: Learning Hierarchical Representation for Functions of Source Code in Hyperbolic Space.

Hence, learning an effective representation model for the functions of source code, from a modern view, is a crucial problem. Considering the inherent hierarchy of functions, we propose a novel hyperbolic function embedding (HFE) method, which can learn a distributed and hierarchical representation for each function via the Poincar\u00e9 ball model. To achieve this, a function call graph (FCG) is first constructed to model the call relationship among functions. To verify the underlying geometry of FCG, the Ricci curvature model is used. Finally, an HFE model is built to learn the representations that can capture the latent hierarchy of functions in the hyperbolic space, instead of the Euclidean space, which are usually used in those state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HFE is more compact in terms of lower dimensionality than the existing graph embedding methods. Thus, HFE is more effective in terms of computation and storage. To experimentally evaluate the performance of HFE, two application scenarios, namely, function classification and link prediction, have been applied. HFE achieves up to 7.6% performance improvement compared to the chosen state-of-the-art methods, namely, Node2vec and Struc2vec.\n\n61: Fully Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision.

International Conference on Learning Representations, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: Real-world visual data exhibit intrinsic hierarchical structures that can be represented effectively in hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) are a promising approach for learning feature representations in such spaces. However, current HNNs in computer vision rely on Euclidean backbones and only project features to the hyperbolic space in the task heads, limiting their ability to fully leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry. To address this, we present HCNN, a fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalize fundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of the convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression. {Experiments on standard vision tasks demonstrate the promising performance of our HCNN framework in both hybrid and fully hyperbolic settings.} Overall, we believe our contributions provide a foundation for developing more powerful HNNs that can better represent complex structures found in image data.

To mitigate this, linear attention mechanisms have been explored but struggle to capture the hierarchical structure of skeleton data. Meanwhile, the Poincar\\'e model, as a typical hyperbolic geometry, offers a powerful framework for modeling hierarchical structures but lacks well-defined operations for existing mainstream linear attention. In this paper, we propose HyLiFormer, a novel hyperbolic linear attention Transformer tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. Our approach incorporates a Hyperbolic Transformation with Curvatures (HTC) module to map skeleton data into hyperbolic space and a Hyperbolic Linear Attention (HLA) module for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that HyLiFormer significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving model accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficiency-critical applications.\n\n63: HMANet: Hyperbolic Manifold Aware Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition.

IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 5\nAbstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted significant attentions in recent years. To model the skeleton data, most popular methods utilize graph convolutional networks to fuse nodes located in different parts of the graph to obtain rich geometric information. However, these methods cannot be generalized to different graph structures due to their dependencies on the input of the topological structure. In this article, we design a novel hyperbolic manifold aware network without introducing a dynamic graph. Instead, it leverages Riemannian geometry attributes of a hyperbolic manifold. Specifically, this method utilizes the Poincar\u00e9 model to embed the tree-like structure of the skeleton into a hyperbolic space to automatically capture hierarchical features, which may explore the underlying manifold of the data. To extract spatio-temporal features in the network, the features in manifold space are projected to a tangent space, and a tangent space features translation method based on the Levi\u2013Civita connection was proposed. In addition, we introduce the geometric knowledge of Riemannian manifolds to further explain how features are transformed in the tangent space. Finally, we conduct experiments on several 3-D skeleton data sets with different structures, successfully verifying the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed method.\n\n64: Complex Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings with Fast Fourier Transform.

Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: The choice of geometric space for knowledge graph (KG) embeddings can have significant effects on the performance of KG completion tasks. The hyperbolic geometry has been shown to capture the hierarchical patterns due to its tree-like metrics, which addressed the limitations of the Euclidean embedding models. Recent explorations of the complex hyperbolic geometry further improved the hyperbolic embeddings for capturing a variety of hierarchical structures. However, the performance of the hyperbolic KG embedding models for non-transitive relations is still unpromising, while the complex hyperbolic embeddings do not deal with multi-relations. This paper aims to utilize the representation capacity of the complex hyperbolic geometry in multi-relational KG embeddings. To apply the geometric transformations which account for different relations and the attention mechanism in the complex hyperbolic space, we propose to use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) as the conversion between the real and complex hyperbolic space. Constructing the attention-based transformations in the complex space is very challenging, while the proposed Fourier transform-based complex hyperbolic approaches provide a simple and effective solution. Experimental results show that our methods outperform the baselines, including the Euclidean and the real hyperbolic embedding models.\n\n65: Machine Unlearning in Hyperbolic vs. Euclidean Multimodal Contrastive Learning: Adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU.

While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

Yu'}]. 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), 2022.\nNumber of citations: 6\nAbstract: Session-based Recommendation (SBR) is to predict users\u2019 next interested items based on their previous browsing sessions. Existing methods model sessions as graphs or sequences to estimate user interests based on their interacted items to make recommendations. In recent years, graph-based methods have achieved outstanding performance on SBR. However, none of these methods consider temporal information, which is a crucial feature in SBR as it indicates timeliness or currency. Besides, the session graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure and are demonstrated to be suitable in hyperbolic geometry. But few papers design the models in hyperbolic spaces and this direction is still under exploration.In this paper, we propose Time-aware Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network (TA-HGAT) \u2014 a novel hyperbolic graph neural network framework to build a session-based recommendation model considering temporal information. More specifically, there are three components in TA-HGAT. First, a hyperbolic projection module transforms the item features into hyperbolic space. Second, the time-aware graph attention module models time intervals between items and the users\u2019 current interests. Third, an evolutionary loss at the end of the model provides an accurate prediction of the recommended item based on the given timestamp. TA-HGAT is built in a hyperbolic space to learn the hierarchical structure of session graphs. Experimental results show that the proposed TA-HGAT has the best performance compared to ten baseline models on two real-world datasets.\n\n67: A Bayesian Approach to Hyperbolic Multi-Dimensional Scaling.

However, available embedding methods do not give a precise metric for determining the dimensionality of the data, and do not vary curvature. These parameters are important for obtaining accurate, low dimensional, continuous descriptions of the data. To address this we develop a Bayesian formulation of Multi-Dimensional Scaling for embedding data in hyperbolic spaces that can fit for the optimal values of geometric parameters such as curvature and dimension. We propose a novel model of embedding uncertainty within this Bayesian framework which improves both performance and interpretability of the model. Because the method allows for variable curvature, it can also correctly embed Euclidean data using zero curvature, thus subsuming traditional Euclidean MDS models. We demonstrate that only a small amount of data is needed to constrain the geometry in our model and that the model is robust against false minima when scaling to large datasets. We apply our model to real world datasets and uncover new insights into their hierarchical structure derived from our geometric embeddings.\n\n68: HLoOP\u2014Hyperbolic 2-Space Local Outlier Probabilities.

IEEE Access, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Hyperbolic geometry has recently garnered considerable attention in machine learning due to its ability to embed hierarchical graph structures with low distortions for further downstream processing. This paper introduces a simple framework to detect local outliers for datasets grounded in hyperbolic 2-space, which is referred to as Hyperbolic Local Outlier Probability (HLoOP). Within a Euclidean space, well-known techniques for local outlier detection are based on the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and its variant, the LoOP (Local Outlier Probability), which incorporates probabilistic concepts to model the outlier level of a data vector. The proposed HLoOP combines the notion of finding nearest neighbors, density-based outlier scoring with a probabilistic, statistically oriented approach. Therefore, the method computes the Riemmanian distance of a data point to its nearest neighbors following a Gaussian probability density function expressed in a hyperbolic space. This is achieved by defining a Gaussian cumulative distribution in this space. The proposed HLoOP algorithm is tested on the WordNet dataset and desmonstrated promising results. The code and data will be made available upon request for reproducibility.\n\n69: Provably accurate and scalable linear classifiers in hyperbolic spaces.

Such data sets are hard to process in Euclidean spaces, and one often seeks low-dimensional embeddings in other space forms to perform the required learning tasks. For hierarchical data, the space of choice is a hyperbolic space because it guarantees low-distortion embeddings for tree-like structures. The geometry of hyperbolic spaces has properties not encountered in Euclidean spaces that pose challenges when trying to rigorously analyze algorithmic solutions. We propose a unified framework for learning scalable and simple hyperbolic linear classifiers with provable performance guarantees. The gist of our approach is to focus on Poincar\u00e9 ball models and formulate the classification problems using tangent space formalisms. Our results include a new hyperbolic perceptron algorithm as well as an efficient and highly accurate convex optimization setup for hyperbolic support vector machine classifiers. Furthermore, we adapt our approach to accommodate second-order perceptrons, where data are preprocessed based on second-order information (correlation) to accelerate convergence, and strategic perceptrons, where potentially manipulated data arrive in an online manner and decisions are made sequentially. The excellent performance of the Poincar\u00e9 second-order and strategic perceptrons shows that the proposed framework can be extended to general machine learning problems in hyperbolic spaces. Our experimental results, pertaining to synthetic, single-cell RNA-seq expression measurements, CIFAR10, Fashion-MNIST and mini-ImageNet, establish that all algorithms provably converge and have complexity comparable to those of their Euclidean counterparts.\n\n70: Hyperbolic Attention Networks.

Embedding discrete hierarchical structures in hyperbolic geometry has proven very successful since it was shown that any weighted tree can be embedded in that geometry with arbitrary low distortion. Various optimization methods for hyperbolic embeddings based on common models of hyperbolic geometry have been studied. In this paper, we consider Hilbert geometry for the standard simplex which is isometric to a vector space equipped with the variation polytope norm. We study the representation power of this Hilbert simplex geometry by embedding distance matrices of graphs.

Hyperbolic geometry offers an exciting alternative, as it enables embeddings with much smaller distortion. However, extending GCNs to hyperbolic geometry presents several unique challenges because it is not clear how to define neural network operations, such as feature transformation and aggregation, in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it is unclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right amount of curvature. Here we propose Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs. We derive GCNs operations in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space and map Euclidean input features to embeddings in hyperbolic spaces with different trainable curvature at each layer. Experiments demonstrate that HGCN learns embeddings that preserve hierarchical structure, and leads to improved performance when compared to Euclidean analogs, even with very low dimensional embeddings: compared to state-of-the-art GCNs, HGCN achieves an error reduction of up to 63.1% in ROC AUC for link prediction and of up to 47.5% in F1 score for node classification, also improving state-of-the art on the Pubmed dataset.\n\n75: Skin Lesion Recognition with Class-Hierarchy Regularized Hyperbolic Embeddings.

However, existing classification algorithms for medical diagnoses often assume semantically independent labels. In this study, we aim to leverage class hierarchy with deep learning algorithms for more accurate and reliable skin lesion recognition. We propose a hyperbolic network to learn image embeddings and class prototypes jointly. The hyperbola provably provides a space for modeling hierarchical relations better than Euclidean geometry. Meanwhile, we restrict the distribution of hyperbolic prototypes with a distance matrix that is encoded from the class hierarchy. Accordingly, the learned prototypes preserve the semantic class relations in the embedding space and we can predict the label of an image by assigning its feature to the nearest hyperbolic class prototype. We use an in-house skin lesion dataset which consists of around 230k dermoscopic images on 65 skin diseases to verify our method. Extensive experiments provide evidence that our model can achieve higher accuracy with less severe classification errors than models without considering class relations.\n\n76: HyperSteiner: Computing Heuristic Hyperbolic Steiner Minimal Trees.

International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: Modeling substitutable and complementary item relationships is a fundamental and important topic for recommendation in e-commerce online scenarios. In the real world, item relationships are usually coupled, heterogeneous and they also have abundant side information and hierarchical data structures. Recently, to take full advantage of both sides information and topological structure, graph neural networks are widely explored in relationship modeling. However, the existing methods are crude in decoupling heterogeneous relationships. Their model designs lack deep insight of relationships' coupling mode, i.e. neglects the prior knowledge of how relationships affect each other. In addition, many existing graph methods, regardless of how they handle coupled relationships, are deployed in Euclidean spaces, which distorts hierarchical data structure and limits the expressive power due to the non power law characteristic of Euclidean topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupled Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network (DHGAN). The innovations of our DHGAN can be highlighted as two aspects. Firstly, we design metapaths in an adequate way following an algebraic perspective of relationships coupling mode, which helps achieving better model interpretability. Secondly, DHGAN maps heterogeneous relationships into separate hyperbolic spaces, which can better capture the hierarchical information of graph nodes and helps improving model's representational capacity. We conduct extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets, demonstrating DHGAN is superior to the state-of-the-art graph baselines.

IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user might click within an ongoing session, without relying on user profiles or historical data. Modern approaches typically use graph networks to learn item embeddings in Euclidean space via graph convolution operations. However, they often struggle to capture the diversity of user interactions within short, hierarchically structured sessions, which is essential for accurate predictions in SBR. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-interest hyperbolic representation network (MIHRN) to enhance the performance of SBR by adeptly modeling both intricate high-order spatial structures and sequence relationships among items in hyperbolic geometry space. Specifically, we use a hyperbolic hypergraph neural network to exploit the high-order spatial relationships and local clustering structures inherent within sessions. Subsequently, a multiaspect interest representation module is designed to articulate the diversity of user interests. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance improvements of 23.81%, 14.81%, and 36.84%, respectively, under the P@10 metric.\n\n79: HC-GLAD: Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection.

Most existing methods that rely on traditional GNNs mainly consider pairwise relationships between first-order neighbors, which is insufficient to capture the complex high-order dependencies often associated with anomalies. This limitation underscores the necessity of exploring high-order node interactions in UGAD. In addition, most previous works ignore the underlying properties (e.g., hierarchy and power-law structure) which are common in real-world graph datasets and therefore are indispensable factors in the UGAD task. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (HC-GLAD in short). To exploit high-order node group information, we construct hypergraphs based on pre-designed gold motifs and subsequently perform hypergraph convolution. Furthermore, to preserve the hierarchy of real-world graphs, we introduce hyperbolic geometry into this field and conduct both graph and hypergraph embedding learning in hyperbolic space with the hyperboloid model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously apply hypergraph with node group information and hyperbolic geometry in this field. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets of different fields demonstrate the superiority of HC-GLAD on the UGAD task.

Neural Information Processing Systems, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes or an inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed cheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this hierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [Zeng et al., 2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al., 2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure: a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based representation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any standard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance especially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of structured representation, we perform eigenvalue analysis that links the representation geometry to improved Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection performance seen empirically.

The expansive nature and exponential volume-diameter relationship of hyperbolic space, in comparison to traditional Euclidean space and manifolds, demonstrate advantages in managing data with complex hierarchical structures. In PHGT, the model's ability to recognize and process hierarchical structures is enhanced through the use of geodesic distances in hyperbolic space, replacing traditional dot product operations. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the standard datasets ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, verifying the effectiveness of PHGT in 3D point cloud classification. Results indicate that PHGT surpasses existing methods based on traditional manifold spaces in terms of classification accuracy and generalization capability. This study not only highlights the potential application of hyperbolic space in handling complex point cloud data but also offers valuable insights for the integration of hyperbolic geometry into other complex data analysis tasks in the future.\n\n82: Dynamic community detection algorithm based on hyperbolic graph convolution.

International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: PurposeCommunity detection is a key factor in analyzing the structural features of complex networks. However, traditional dynamic community detection methods often fail to effectively solve the problems of deep network information loss and computational complexity in hyperbolic space. To address this challenge, a hyperbolic space-based dynamic graph neural network community detection model (HSDCDM) is proposed.Design/methodology/approachHSDCDM first projects the node features into the hyperbolic space and then utilizes the hyperbolic graph convolution module on the Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz models to realize feature fusion and information transfer. In addition, the parallel optimized temporal memory module ensures fast and accurate capture of time domain information over extended periods. Finally, the community clustering module divides the community structure by combining the node characteristics of the space domain and the time domain. To evaluate the performance of HSDCDM, experiments are conducted on both artificial and real datasets.FindingsExperimental results on complex networks demonstrate that HSDCDM significantly enhances the quality of community detection in hierarchical networks. It shows an average improvement of 7.29% in NMI and a 9.07% increase in ARI across datasets compared to traditional methods. For complex networks with non-Euclidean geometric structures, the HSDCDM model incorporating hyperbolic geometry can better handle the discontinuity of the metric space, provides a more compact embedding that preserves the data structure, and offers advantages over methods based on Euclidean geometry methods.Originality/valueThis model aggregates the potential information of nodes in space through manifold-preserving distribution mapping and hyperbolic graph topology modules. Moreover, it optimizes the Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU) on the hyperbolic space Lorentz model to effectively extract time series data in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing computing efficiency by eliminating the reliance on tangent space.\n\n83: Hyperbolic Online Time Stream Modeling.

Such temporal streams of information show power-law dynamics, scale-free characteristics, and time irregularities that sequential models are unable to accurately model. In this work, we propose the first Hierarchical Time-Aware Hyperbolic LSTM (HTLSTM), which leverages the Riemannian manifold for encoding the scale-free nature of a sequence of text in a time-aware fashion. Through experiments on three financial tasks: stock trading, equity price movement prediction, and financial risk prediction, we demonstrate HTLSTM's applicability for modeling temporal sequences of online information. On real-world data from four global stock markets and three stock indices spanning data in English and Chinese, we make a step towards time-aware text modeling via hyperbolic geometry.\n\n84: Hyperbolic Graph Representation Learning: A Tutorial.

Recently, hyperbolic spaces have emerged as a promising alternative for processing graph data with tree-like structure or power-law distribution, owing to the exponential growth property. Different from Euclidean space, which expands polynomially, the hyperbolic space grows exponentially which makes it gains natural advantages in abstracting tree-like or scale-free graphs with hierarchical organizations. In this tutorial, we aim to give an introduction to this emerging field of graph representation learning with the express purpose of being accessible to all audiences. We first give a brief introduction to graph representation learning as well as some preliminary Riemannian and hyperbolic geometry. We then comprehensively revisit the hyperbolic embedding techniques, including hyperbolic shallow models and hyperbolic neural networks. In addition, we introduce the technical details of the current hyperbolic graph neural networks by unifying them into a general framework and summarizing the variants of each component. Moreover, we further introduce a series of related applications in a variety of fields. In the last part, we discuss several advanced topics about hyperbolic geometry for graph representation learning, which potentially serve as guidelines for further flourishing the non-Euclidean graph learning community.\n\n85: Dynamic Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding in Hyperbolic Space.

International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, 2022.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: \u2014Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding, aiming to project HIN into a low-dimensional space, has attracted considerable research attention. Existing heterogeneous graph representation learning methods also take temporal evolution into consideration in Euclidean space which, however, un-derestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To explore these properties of a dynamic heterogeneous network, we propose a dynamic hyperbolic heterogeneous embedding(DyHHE) model that fully takes advantage of the hyperbolic geometry and structural heterogeneity. More specially, to capture the structure and semantic relations between nodes, we employ the meta-path guided random walk to sample the sequences for each node. Then DyHHE maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and capture the structural heterogeneity and evolving behaviors by facilitating the proximity measurement. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DyHHE, as it consistently outperforms competing methods in link prediction task.\n\n86: Pseudo-Poincar\u00e9: A Unification Framework for Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks.

The primary reason for this success is the effectiveness of the hyperbolic space in capturing the inherent hierarchy of graph datasets. However, they are limited in terms of generalization, scalability, and have inferior performance when it comes to non-hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we take a completely orthogonal perspective for modeling hyperbolic networks. We use Poincar\u00e9 disk to model the hyperbolic geometry and also treat it as if the disk itself is a tangent space at origin. This enables us to replace non-scalable M\u00f6bius gyrovector operations with an Euclidean approximation, and thus simplifying the entire hyperbolic model to a Euclidean model cascaded with a hyperbolic normalization function. Our approach does not adhere to M\u00f6bius math, yet it still works in the Riemannian manifold, hence we call it Pseudo-Poincar\u00e9 framework. We applied our non-linear hyperbolic normalization to the current state-of-the-art homogeneous and multi-relational graph networks and demonstrate signi\ufb01cant improvements in performance compared to both Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts. The primary impact of this work lies in its ability to capture hierarchical features in the Euclidean space, and thus, can replace hyperbolic networks without loss in performance metrics while simultaneously leveraging the power of Euclidean networks such as interpretability and ef\ufb01cient execution of various model components.\n\n87: Visualization of Escher-like Spiral Patterns in Hyperbolic Space.

Nonetheless, research on their aesthetic visualization is extremely limited. In this paper, we give a simple method for creating Escher-like hyperbolic spiral patterns. To this end, we first present a fast algorithm to construct Euclidean spiral tilings with cyclic symmetry. Then, based on a one-to-one mapping between Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, we establish two simple approaches for constructing spiral tilings in hyperbolic models. Finally, we use wallpaper templates to render such tilings, which results in the desired Escher-like hyperbolic spiral patterns. The method proposed is able to generate a great variety of visually appealing patterns.\n\n88: Modeling Graphs Beyond Hyperbolic: Graph Neural Networks in Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices.

ECML/PKDD, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 7\nAbstract: Recent research has shown that alignment between the structure of graph data and the geometry of an embedding space is crucial for learning high-quality representations of the data. The uniform geometry of Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces allows for representing graphs with uniform geometric and topological features, such as grids and hierarchies, with minimal distortion. However, real-world graph data is characterized by multiple types of geometric and topological features, necessitating more sophisticated geometric embedding spaces. In this work, we utilize the Riemannian symmetric space of symmetric positive definite matrices (SPD) to construct graph neural networks that can robustly handle complex graphs. To do this, we develop an innovative library that leverages the SPD gyrocalculus tools \\cite{lopez2021gyroSPD} to implement the building blocks of five popular graph neural networks in SPD. Experimental results demonstrate that our graph neural networks in SPD substantially outperform their counterparts in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, as well as the Cartesian product thereof, on complex graphs for node and graph classification tasks. We release the library and datasets at \\url{https://github.com/andyweizhao/SPD4GNNs}.\n\n89: The geometry of genericity in mapping class groups and Teichm\\\"uller spaces via CAT(0) cube complexes.

Qing-Rafi-Tiozzo recently introduced the sublinearly Morse boundary and proved that this boundary is a quasi-isometry invariant which captures a notion of generic direction in a broad context. In this article, we develop the geometric foundations of sublinear Morseness in the mapping class group and Teichm\u00fcller space. We prove that their sublinearly Morse boundaries are visibility spaces and admit continuous equivariant injections into the boundary of the curve graph. Moreover, we completely characterize sublinear Morseness in terms of the hierarchical structures of these spaces. Our techniques include developing tools for modeling the hulls of median rays in hierarchically hyperbolic spaces via CAT(0) cube complexes. Part of this analysis involves establishing direct connections between the geometry of the curve graph and the combinatorics of hyperplanes in the approximating cube complexes.\n\n90: ACE-HGNN: Adaptive Curvature Exploration Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network.

Most existing GNNs embed graph data into Euclidean space and thus are less effective to capture the ubiquitous hierarchical structures in real-world networks. Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) extend GNNs to hyperbolic space and thus are more effective to capture the hierarchical structures of graphs in node representation learning. In hyperbolic geometry, the graph hierarchical structure can be reflected by the curvatures of the hyperbolic space, and different curvatures can model different hierarchical structures of a graph. However, most existing HGNNs manually set the curvature to a fixed value for simplicity, which achieves a suboptimal performance of graph learning due to the complex and diverse hierarchical structures of the graphs. To resolve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Curvature Exploration Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network named ACE-HGNN to adaptively learn the optimal curvature according to the input graph and downstream tasks. Specifically, ACE-HGNN exploits a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework and contains two agents, ACE-Agent and HGNN-Agent for learning the curvature and node representations, respectively. The two agents are updated by a Nash Q-leaning algorithm collaboratively, seeking the optimal hyperbolic space indexed by the curvature. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets demonstrate a significant and consistent performance improvement in model quality with competitive performance and good generalization ability.\n\n91: Unsupervised Hyperbolic Representation Learning via Message Passing Auto-Encoders.

In this paper, we analyze how unsupervised tasks can benefit from learned representations in hyperbolic space. To explore how well the hierarchical structure of un-labeled data can be represented in hyperbolic spaces, we design a novel hyperbolic message passing auto-encoder whose overall auto-encoding is performed in hyperbolic space. The proposed model conducts auto-encoding the networks via fully utilizing hyperbolic geometry in message passing. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we validate the properties and benefits of the unsupervised hyperbolic representations.

Neural Information Processing Systems, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 168\nAbstract: The Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) is a popular method for learning a generative model and embeddings of the data. Many real datasets are hierarchically structured. However, traditional VAEs map data in a Euclidean latent space which cannot efficiently embed tree-like structures. Hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature can. We therefore endow VAEs with a Poincare ball model of hyperbolic geometry as a latent space and rigorously derive the necessary methods to work with two main Gaussian generalisations on that space. We empirically show better generalisation to unseen data than the Euclidean counterpart, and can qualitatively and quantitatively better recover hierarchical structures.\n\n93: Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding.

AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2019.\nNumber of citations: 116\nAbstract: Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding, aiming to project HIN into a low-dimensional space, has attracted considerable research attention. Most of the exiting HIN embedding methods focus on preserving the inherent network structure and semantic correlations in Euclidean spaces. However, one fundamental problem is that whether the Euclidean spaces are the appropriate or intrinsic isometric spaces of HIN? Recent researches argue that the complex network may have the hyperbolic geometry underneath, because the underlying hyperbolic geometry can naturally reflect some properties of complex network, e.g., hierarchical and power-law structure. In this paper, we make the first effort toward HIN embedding in hyperbolic spaces. We analyze the structures of two real-world HINs and discover some properties, e.g., the power-law distribution, also exist in HIN. Therefore, we propose a novel hyperbolic heterogeneous information network embedding model. Specifically, to capture the structure and semantic relations between nodes, we employ the meta-path guided random walk to sample the sequences for each node. Then we exploit the distance in hyperbolic spaces as the proximity measurement. The hyperbolic distance is able to meet the triangle inequality and well preserve the transitivity in HIN. Our model enables the nodes and their neighborhoods have small hyperbolic distances. We further derive the effective optimization strategy to update the hyperbolic embeddings iteratively. The experimental results, in comparison with the state-of-the-art, demonstrate that our proposed model not only has superior performance on network reconstruction and link prediction tasks but also shows its ability of capture hierarchy structure in HIN via visualization.\n\n94: FGNET-RH: Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing via Refinement in Hyperbolic Space.

While distant supervision is the most common way to acquire supervised training data, it brings in label noise, as it assigns type labels to the entity mentions irrespective of mentions\u2019 context. In attempts to deal with the label noise, leading research on the FG-NET assumes that the fine-grained entity typing data possesses a euclidean nature, which restraints the ability of the existing models in combating the label noise. Given the fact that the fine-grained type hierarchy exhibits a hierarchical structure, it makes hyperbolic space a natural choice to model the FG-NET data. In this research, we propose FGNET-RH, a novel framework that benefits from the hyperbolic geometry in combination with the graph structures to perform entity typing in a performance-enhanced fashion. FGNET-RH initially uses LSTM networks to encode the mention in relation with its context, later it forms a graph to distill/refine the mention\u2019s encodings in the hyperbolic space. Finally, the refined mention encoding is used for entity typing. Experimentation using different benchmark datasets shows that FGNET-RH improves the performance on FG-NET by up to 3.5% in terms of strict accuracy.\n\n95: Applications of information geometry to spiking neural network activity..

Physical Review E, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The space of possible behaviors that complex biological systems may exhibit is unimaginably vast, and these systems often appear to be stochastic, whether due to variable noisy environmental inputs or intrinsically generated chaos. The brain is a prominent example of a biological system with complex behaviors. The number of possible patterns of spikes emitted by a local brain circuit is combinatorially large, although the brain may not make use of all of them. Understanding which of these possible patterns are actually used by the brain, and how those sets of patterns change as properties of neural circuitry change is a major goal in neuroscience. Recently, tools from information geometry have been used to study embeddings of probabilistic models onto a hierarchy of model manifolds that encode how model outputs change as a function of their parameters, giving a quantitative notion of \"distances\" between outputs. We apply this method to a network model of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations to understand how the competition between membrane and synaptic response timescales shapes the network's information geometry. The hyperbolic embedding allows us to identify the statistical parameters to which the model behavior is most sensitive, and demonstrate how the ranking of these coordinates changes with the balance of excitation and inhibition in the network.\n\n96: Hyperbolic disc embedding of functional human brain connectomes using resting-state fMRI.

Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we constructed a scale-free binary graph for each subject, using internodal time-series correlation of regions-of-interest (ROIs) as a proximity measure. The resulted network could be embedded onto manifolds of various curvature and dimensions. While maintaining the fidelity of embedding (low distortion, high mean average precision), functional brain networks were found to be best represented in the hyperbolic disc. Using a popularity-similarity optimization model (PSOM) on the hyperbolic plane, we reduced the dimension of the network into 2-D hyperbolic space and were able to efficiently visualize the internodal connections of the brain, preserving proximity as distances and angles on the PSOM discs. Each individual PSOM disc revealed decentralized nature of information flow and anatomic relevance. Using the hyperbolic distance on the PSOM disc, we could detect the anomaly of network in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects. This procedure of embedding grants us a reliable new framework for studying functional brain networks and the possibility of detecting anomalies of the network in the hyperbolic disc on an individual scale.\n\n97: A Differentiable Gaussian-like Distribution on Hyperbolic Space for Gradient-Based Learning.

Our distribution enables the gradient-based learning of the probabilistic models on hyperbolic space that could never have been considered before. Also, we can sample from this hyperbolic probability distribution without resorting to auxiliary means like rejection sampling. As applications of our distribution, we develop a hyperbolic-analog of variational autoencoder and a method of probabilistic word embedding on hyperbolic space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our distribution on various datasets including MNIST, Atari 2600 Breakout, and WordNet.\n\n98: Do the Angles of a Triangle Add up to 180{\\deg}? -- Introducing Non-Euclidean Geometry.

On the other hand, the existing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based neural topic models perform satisfactorily, but they remain constrained by pattern collapse due to the discontinuity of latent space. To solve the above problems, with the hypothesis of hyperbolic space, we propose a novel GAN-based hierarchical topic model to mine high-quality topics by introducing contrastive learning to capture information from documents. Furthermore, the distinct tree-like property of hyperbolic space preserves the implicit hierarchical semantics of documents in topic embeddings, which are projected into the hyperbolic space.

Prior studies have suggested that features (e.g., color, animacy, etc.) and typicality (e.g., robin vs. penguin) of object images influences the likelihood of being remembered. However, a complete understanding of object memorability remains elusive. In this study, we examine whether the geometric relationship between object concepts explains differences in their memorability. Specifically, we hypothesize that image concepts will be geometrically arranged in hierarchical structures and that memorability will be explained by a concept\u2019s depth in these hierarchical trees. To test this hypothesis, we construct a Hyperbolic representation space of object concepts (N=1,854) from the THINGS database (Hebart et al., 2019), which consists of naturalistic images of concrete objects, and a space of 49 feature dimensions derived from data-driven models. Using ALBATROSS (Stier, A. J., Giusti, C., & Berman, M. G., In prep), a stochastic topological data analysis technique that detects underlying structures of data, we demonstrate that Hyperbolic geometry efficiently captures the hierarchical organization of object concepts above and beyond a traditional Euclidean geometry and that hierarchical organization is related to memorability. We find that concepts closer to the center of the representational space are more prototypical and also more memorable. Importantly, Hyperbolic distances are more predictive of memorability and prototypicality than Euclidean distances, suggesting that concept memorability and typicality are organized hierarchically. Taken together, our work presents a novel hierarchical representational structure of object concepts that explains memorability and typicality.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2024, "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.22.614329", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11463604, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To effectively represent continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs), various temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been developed to model their dynamics and topological structures in Euclidean space. Despite their notable achievements, the performance of Euclidean-based TGNNs is limited and bounded by the representation capabilities of Euclidean geometry, particularly for complex graphs with hierarchical and power-law structures. This is because Euclidean space does not have enough room (its volume grows polynomially with respect to radius) to learn hierarchical structures that expand exponentially. As a result, this leads to high-distortion embeddings and suboptimal temporal graph representations. To break the limitations and enhance the representation capabilities of TGNNs, in this article, we propose a scalable and effective TGNN with hyperbolic geometries for CTDG representation (called STGNh ). It captures evolving behaviors and stores hierarchical structures simultaneously by integrating a memory-based module and a structure-based module into a unified framework, which can scale to billion-scale graphs. Concretely, a simple hyperbolic update gate (HuG) is designed as the memory-based module to store temporal dynamics efficiently; for the structure-based module, we propose an effective hyperbolic temporal Transformer (HyT) model to capture complex graph structures and generate up-to-date node embeddings. Extensive experimental results on a variety of medium-scale and billion-scale graphs demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STGNh for CTDG representation, as it significantly outperforms baselines in various downstream tasks.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "year": 2024, "citationCount": 2, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3394161?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3394161, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Typically, these trees are produced using standard methods like hierarchical clustering, neighbor joining, or maximum likelihood. However, such methods are non-parametric: they require all data to be present at the time of tree formation, and the addition of new data points necessitates the regeneration of the entire tree, a potentially expensive process. They also do not easily integrate with larger workflows. In this study, we aim to address these problems by introducing parametric deep learning methods for tree formation from genotype data. Our models specifically create continuous representations of population trees in hyperbolic space, which has previously proven highly effective in embedding hierarchically structured data. We present two different architectures - a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a variational autoencoder (VAE) - and we analyze their performance using a variety of metrics along with comparisons to established tree-building methods. Both models tested produce embedding spaces that reflect human evolutionary history. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of these models by verifying that addition of new samples to an existing tree occurs in a semantically meaningful manner. Finally, we use Dasgupta\u2019s Cost to compare the quality of trees generated by our models to those produced by established methods. Despite the fact that the benchmark methods are directly fit on the evaluation data, our models are able to outperform some of these and achieve highly comparable performance overall. Author summary Tree production is a vital task in population genetics, but current approaches fall prey to several common shortfalls. Most notably, they lack the ability to add new data points after tree generation, and they are often difficult to use in larger pipelines. By leveraging cutting-edge advances pairing deep learning with hyperbolic geometry, we develop multiple models designed to rectify these issues. Through experiments on a dataset of humans from globally widespread ancestries, we demonstrate the generalizability of our models to new data, and we also show strong empirical performance with respect to currently used methods. In addition, we show that the data representations produced by our models are semantically meaningful and reflect known facts about human evolutionary history. Finally, we discuss the additional benefits our models could provide, including improved visualization, greater privacy preservation, and improved integration with downstream machine learning tasks.

The text-shape pairs exhibit a hierarchical structure, where a general text like \u201cchair\u201d covers all 3D shapes of the chair, while more detailed prompts refer to more specific shapes. Furthermore, both text and 3D shapes are inherently hierarchical structures. However, existing Text2Shape methods, such as SDFusion, do not exploit that. In this work, we propose HyperSD-Fusion, a dual-branch diffusion model that generates 3D shapes from a given text. Since hyperbolic space is suitable for handling hierarchical data, we propose to learn the hierarchical representations of text and 3D shapes in hyperbolic space. First, we introduce a hyperbolic text-image encoder to learn the sequential and multi-modal hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In addition, we design a hyperbolic text-graph convolution module to learn the hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In order to fully utilize these text features, we introduce a dual-branch structure to embed text features in 3D feature space. At last, to endow the generated 3D shapes with a hierarchical structure, we devise a hyperbolic hierarchical loss.

To address these issues, we propose to conduct rare skin disease diagnosis in hyperbolic space, which facilitates implicit class hierarchical structures and precise uncertainty measurement due to pivotal geometrical properties. We propose a Hyperbolic Geometry-driven Robustness Enhancement (HGRE) framework specifically tailored for diagnosing rare skin diseases. The HGRE framework uses implicit hierarchical relation in the hyperbolic space to better represent the features of rare diseases. Moreover, the framework incorporates an Adversarial Proxy Construction (APC) module to address the problem of data uncertainty. Specifically, the APC module uses the distance to the hyperbolic space origin as an indicator of uncertainty to filter and construct adversarial proxies for each uncertain prototype to achieve adversarial robust training. Leveraging the two unique geometrical properties, our HGRE framework effectively addresses the limitations of insufficient hierarchical relation utilization and data uncertainty in FSL-based rare skin disease diagnosis.

Efforts are mainly focused on modeling structural dependencies and temporal evolving regularities in Euclidean space which, however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To explore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. More specially, HTGN maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and incorporates hyperbolic graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network, to capture the evolving behaviors and implicitly preserve hierarchical information simultaneously. Furthermore, in the hyperbolic space, we propose two important modules that enable HTGN to successfully model temporal networks: (1) hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention (HTA) module to attend to historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency (HTC) module to ensure stability and generalization. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTGN for temporal graph embedding, as it consistently outperforms competing methods by significant margins in various temporal link prediction tasks. Specifically, HTGN achieves AUC improvement up to 9.98% for link prediction and 11.4% for new link prediction. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the representational ability of hyperbolic geometry and the effectiveness of the proposed HTA and HTC modules.", "venue": "Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "year": 2021, "citationCount": 116, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03767", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03767, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We thus propose to embed events into hyperbolic spaces, which are intrinsically oriented at modeling hierarchical structures.

Different from conventional reinforcement learning-based crowd navigation methods, Hyp2Nav leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic geometry to better encode the hierarchical nature of decision-making processes in navigation tasks. We propose a hyperbolic policy model and a hyperbolic curiosity module that results in effective social navigation, best success rates, and returns across multiple simulation settings, using up to 6 times fewer parameters than competitor state-of-the-art models. With our approach, it becomes even possible to obtain policies that work in 2-dimensional embedding spaces, opening up new possibilities for low-resource crowd navigation and model interpretability. Insightfully, the internal hyperbolic representation of Hyp2Nav correlates with how much attention the robot pays to the surrounding crowds, e.g. due to multiple people occluding its pathway or to a few of them showing colliding plans, rather than to its own planned route.

Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal input of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging. Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs.

Existing studies on topology-imbalance focus on the location or the local neighborhood structure of nodes, ignoring the global underlying hierarchical properties of the graph, i.e., hierarchy. In the real-world scenario, the hierarchical structure of graph data reveals important topological properties of graphs and is relevant to a wide range of applications. We find that training labeled nodes with different hierarchical properties have a significant impact on the node classification tasks and confirm it in our experiments. It is well known that hyperbolic geometry has a unique advantage in representing the hierarchical structure of graphs. Therefore, we attempt to explore the hierarchy-imbalance issue for node classification of graph neural networks with a novelty perspective of hyperbolic geometry, including its characteristics and causes. Then, we propose a novel hyperbolic geometric hierarchy-imbalance learning framework, named HyperIMBA, to alleviate the hierarchy-imbalance issue caused by uneven hierarchy-levels and cross-hierarchy connectivity patterns of labeled nodes.

While most ML models operate with the conventional Euclidean distance, the hidden hierarchical structure present among a set of phylogenetically related sequences is difficult to represent in Euclidean space without losing much information or requiring many dimensions. Since such hierarchical structure can be informative to analysis tasks such as clustering and classification, we propose two measures for generating a distance matrix from a set of sequences based on distance in the Poincar\u00e9 disk model of hyperbolic geometry, or the Poincar\u00e9 distance, for short. Such a distance measure can allow to embedding of even a fully resolved phylogenetic tree in just two dimensions with minimal distortion to any hierarchical structure.

To alleviate the problem, recent works on multi-behavior recommendation incorporated multiple types of user-item interactions such as click, add-to-cart, and buy. However, the latest approaches are still limited by overlooking early-stage interactions, and have limited expressiveness of Euclidean geometry. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a Multi-behavior Hyperbolic Graph Recommender (MB-HGR) with two novel aspects. First, it uses multiple heterogeneous graphs to learn multiple user behavior types, where each heterogeneous graph represents a user-item interaction type. This will help not only alleviate the serious data sparsity problem, but also allow the model to explicitly weight different behavior types and prevent information loss. Second, it leverages the expressiveness of the hyperbolic geometry over Euclidean geometry, where exponential growth of distances in the hyperbolic geometry matches the exponential growth of nodes in the hierarchical structures and learns better users/items representations.

In spite of the notable successes, the performance of Euclidean models is inherently bounded and limited by the representation ability of Euclidean geometry, especially when it comes to datasets with highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy. Recently, hyperbolic spaces have emerged as a promising alternative for processing graph data with tree-like structure or power-law distribution and a surge of works on either methods or novel applications have been seen. Unlike Euclidean space, which expands polynomially, hyperbolic space grows exponentially with its radius, making it more suitable for modeling complex real-world data. Hence, it gains natural advantages in abstracting tree-like graphs with a hierarchical organization or power-law distribution. To support the burgeoning interest in Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), the primary goal of this tutorial is to give a systematical review of the methods, applications, and challenges in this fast-growing and vibrant area, with the express purpose of being accessible to all audiences.More specifically, we will first give a brief introduction to graph neural networks as well as some preliminary of Riemannian manifold and hyperbolic geometry. We then will comprehensively revisit the technical details of the developed HGNNs, by unifying them into a general framework and summarizing the variants of each component.

Therefore, based on hyperbolic theory, this paper proposes a Hyperbolic Music Transformer model, which considers the hierarchy in music and models the structured components of music in hyperbolic space.

Due to the constant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and captures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic embeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many real-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree networks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not ubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To address this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex hyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation learning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically structured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The unit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity to capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the hyperbolic embedding models significantly.

Recently, some Euclidean KGE methods have been enhanced to model semantic hierarchies commonly found in KGs, improving the performance of link prediction. To embed hierarchical data, hyperbolic space has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Euclidean space, offering high fidelity and lower memory consumption. Unlike Euclidean, hyperbolic space provides countless curvatures to choose from. However, it is difficult for existing hyperbolic KGE methods to obtain the optimal curvature settings manually, thereby limiting their ability to effectively model semantic hierarchies.

This stems primarily from: (i) the absence of well-defined modules in hyperbolic space, including linear transformation layers, LayerNorm layers, activation functions, dropout operations, etc. (ii) the quadratic time complexity of the existing hyperbolic self-attention module w.r.t the number of input tokens, which hinders its scalability.

Nevertheless, the majority of existing methodologies assume a Euclidean embedding space, encountering difficulties in accurately representing richer text information and managing complex interactions between users and items. This paper advocates a hyperbolic CDR approach based on review texts for modeling user-item relationships. We first emphasize that conventional distance-based domain alignment techniques may cause problems because small modifications in hyperbolic geometry result in magnified perturbations, ultimately leading to the collapse of hierarchical structures. To address this challenge, we propose hierarchy-aware embedding and domain alignment schemes that adjust the scale to extract domain-shareable information without disrupting structural forms.

However, current DL-based methods lack an effective means of regularizing the background information. In this article, the hyperbolic space-based autoencoder (HSAE) is proposed for the hyperspectral anomaly detection task. We assume that an effective hierarchical structural representation can better model the HSI in the spatial domain, and this enables the background information to be effectively regularized. Motivated by this idea, the HSAE embeds the HSI into hyperbolic space, which is a non-Euclidean geometry with a constant negative curvature and an exponential growth distance between points.

There has been a lot of research on temporal network representation learning so far. Nonetheless, most of them are based on euclidean geometry, which fails to encode the underlying hierarchical layout or scale-free property of the real-world temporal network. Encouragingly, hyperbolic geometry excels in preserving both node similarity and network hierarchies. In the preliminary work, we proposed a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) on the Poincar\u00e9 ball model, taking advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. HTGN moves the temporal network embedding into hyperbolic space and employs the hyperbolic graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network to capture spatial and temporal dynamics, respectively. In addition, two modules were further put forward to advance the performance: (1) hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention to watch historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency to enforce the embeddings changing gradually. In this work, we further design a lightweight and efficient hyperbolic graph convolutional module that enables HTGN to scale to large-size graphs easily and flexibly handle datasets with different densities.

Despite these claims, our work makes a surprising discovery: when simple Euclidean models with comparable numbers of parameters are properly trained in the same environment, in most cases, they perform as well, if not better, than all introduced hyperbolic graph representation learning models, even on graph datasets previously claimed to be the most hyperbolic as measured by Gromov $\\delta$-hyperbolicity (i.e., perfect trees).

To overcome these limitations, we introduced the attention-based geometry interaction embedding (ATGIE) method, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of multiple geometric spaces, i.e., Euclidean, hyperbolic, and hypersphere, to model the intricacies of TKGs more effectively. ATGIE employs an attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the contributions of different geometric spaces, allowing it to adaptively form reliable spatial structures based on interactive geometric information. This multi-space modeling not only captures the diverse relationships within TKGs but also facilitates a nuanced understanding of how entities and their relationships evolve over time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate ATGIE\u2019s superiority in TKGC tasks, showcasing its improvement over existing methods, robustness to noise, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. The results highlight ATGIE\u2019s potential to advance the state-of-the-art in TKGC, offering a promising direction for research and application in the field.", "venue": "Mathematics", "year": 2024, "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/13/2022/pdf?version=1720163758", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/math12132022?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/math12132022, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We present an index called community closeness (CC) to measure the adjacency relationship between the communities.

Considering the inherent hierarchy of functions, we propose a novel hyperbolic function embedding (HFE) method, which can learn a distributed and hierarchical representation for each function via the Poincar\u00e9 ball model. To achieve this, a function call graph (FCG) is first constructed to model the call relationship among functions. To verify the underlying geometry of FCG, the Ricci curvature model is used. Finally, an HFE model is built to learn the representations that can capture the latent hierarchy of functions in the hyperbolic space, instead of the Euclidean space, which are usually used in those state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HFE is more compact in terms of lower dimensionality than the existing graph embedding methods. Thus, HFE is more effective in terms of computation and storage. To experimentally evaluate the performance of HFE, two application scenarios, namely, function classification and link prediction, have been applied.

This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

Such data sets are hard to process in Euclidean spaces, and one often seeks low-dimensional embeddings in other space forms to perform the required learning tasks. For hierarchical data, the space of choice is a hyperbolic space because it guarantees low-distortion embeddings for tree-like structures. The geometry of hyperbolic spaces has properties not encountered in Euclidean spaces that pose challenges when trying to rigorously analyze algorithmic solutions. We propose a unified framework for learning scalable and simple hyperbolic linear classifiers with provable performance guarantees. The gist of our approach is to focus on Poincar\u00e9 ball models and formulate the classification problems using tangent space formalisms. Our results include a new hyperbolic perceptron algorithm as well as an efficient and highly accurate convex optimization setup for hyperbolic support vector machine classifiers.

Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it is unclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right amount of curvature.

In the real world, item relationships are usually coupled, heterogeneous and they also have abundant side information and hierarchical data structures. Recently, to take full advantage of both sides information and topological structure, graph neural networks are widely explored in relationship modeling. However, the existing methods are crude in decoupling heterogeneous relationships. Their model designs lack deep insight of relationships' coupling mode, i.e. neglects the prior knowledge of how relationships affect each other. In addition, many existing graph methods, regardless of how they handle coupled relationships, are deployed in Euclidean spaces, which distorts hierarchical data structure and limits the expressive power due to the non power law characteristic of Euclidean topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupled Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network (DHGAN). The innovations of our DHGAN can be highlighted as two aspects. Firstly, we design metapaths in an adequate way following an algebraic perspective of relationships coupling mode, which helps achieving better model interpretability. Secondly, DHGAN maps heterogeneous relationships into separate hyperbolic spaces, which can better capture the hierarchical information of graph nodes and helps improving model's representational capacity. We conduct extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets, demonstrating DHGAN is superior to the state-of-the-art graph baselines.

This limitation underscores the necessity of exploring high-order node interactions in UGAD. In addition, most previous works ignore the underlying properties (e.g., hierarchy and power-law structure) which are common in real-world graph datasets and therefore are indispensable factors in the UGAD task.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously apply hypergraph with node group information and hyperbolic geometry in this field.

Extensive experiments on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance especially under low dimensional scenarios.

However, traditional dynamic community detection methods often fail to effectively solve the problems of deep network information loss and computational complexity in hyperbolic space. To address this challenge, a hyperbolic space-based dynamic graph neural network community detection model (HSDCDM) is proposed.Design/methodology/approachHSDCDM first projects the node features into the hyperbolic space and then utilizes the hyperbolic graph convolution module on the Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz models to realize feature fusion and information transfer. In addition, the parallel optimized temporal memory module ensures fast and accurate capture of time domain information over extended periods. Finally, the community clustering module divides the community structure by combining the node characteristics of the space domain and the time domain. To evaluate the performance of HSDCDM, experiments are conducted on both artificial and real datasets.FindingsExperimental results on complex networks demonstrate that HSDCDM significantly enhances the quality of community detection in hierarchical networks. It shows an average improvement of 7.29% in NMI and a 9.07% increase in ARI across datasets compared to traditional methods. For complex networks with non-Euclidean geometric structures, the HSDCDM model incorporating hyperbolic geometry can better handle the discontinuity of the metric space, provides a more compact embedding that preserves the data structure, and offers advantages over methods based on Euclidean geometry methods.Originality/valueThis model aggregates the potential information of nodes in space through manifold-preserving distribution mapping and hyperbolic graph topology modules. Moreover, it optimizes the Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU) on the hyperbolic space Lorentz model to effectively extract time series data in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing computing efficiency by eliminating the reliance on tangent space.", "venue": "International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics", "year": 2024, "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1108/ijicc-01-2024-0017?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1108/ijicc-01-2024-0017, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The primary reason for this success is the effectiveness of the hyperbolic space in capturing the inherent hierarchy of graph datasets. However, they are limited in terms of generalization, scalability, and have inferior performance when it comes to non-hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we take a completely orthogonal perspective for modeling hyperbolic networks. We use Poincar\u00e9 disk to model the hyperbolic geometry and also treat it as if the disk itself is a tangent space at origin. This enables us to replace non-scalable M\u00f6bius gyrovector operations with an Euclidean approximation, and thus simplifying the entire hyperbolic model to a Euclidean model cascaded with a hyperbolic normalization function. Our approach does not adhere to M\u00f6bius math, yet it still works in the Riemannian manifold, hence we call it Pseudo-Poincar\u00e9 framework. We applied our non-linear hyperbolic normalization to the current state-of-the-art homogeneous and multi-relational graph networks and demonstrate signi\ufb01cant improvements in performance compared to both Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts.

Most of the exiting HIN embedding methods focus on preserving the inherent network structure and semantic correlations in Euclidean spaces. However, one fundamental problem is that whether the Euclidean spaces are the appropriate or intrinsic isometric spaces of HIN? Recent researches argue that the complex network may have the hyperbolic geometry underneath, because the underlying hyperbolic geometry can naturally reflect some properties of complex network, e.g., hierarchical and power-law structure. In this paper, we make the first effort toward HIN embedding in hyperbolic spaces. We analyze the structures of two real-world HINs and discover some properties, e.g., the power-law distribution, also exist in HIN. Therefore, we propose a novel hyperbolic heterogeneous information network embedding model. Specifically, to capture the structure and semantic relations between nodes, we employ the meta-path guided random walk to sample the sequences for each node. Then we exploit the distance in hyperbolic spaces as the proximity measurement. The hyperbolic distance is able to meet the triangle inequality and well preserve the transitivity in HIN. Our model enables the nodes and their neighborhoods have small hyperbolic distances. We further derive the effective optimization strategy to update the hyperbolic embeddings iteratively. The experimental results, in comparison with the state-of-the-art, demonstrate that our proposed model not only has superior performance on network reconstruction and link prediction tasks but also shows its ability of capture hierarchy structure in HIN via visualization.", "venue": "AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2019, "citationCount": 116, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/4471/4349", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1609/AAAI.V33I01.33015337?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1609/AAAI.V33I01.33015337, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While distant supervision is the most common way to acquire supervised training data, it brings in label noise, as it assigns type labels to the entity mentions irrespective of mentions\u2019 context. In attempts to deal with the label noise, leading research on the FG-NET assumes that the fine-grained entity typing data possesses a euclidean nature, which restraints the ability of the existing models in combating the label noise. Given the fact that the fine-grained type hierarchy exhibits a hierarchical structure, it makes hyperbolic space a natural choice to model the FG-NET data. In this research, we propose FGNET-RH, a novel framework that benefits from the hyperbolic geometry in combination with the graph structures to perform entity typing in a performance-enhanced fashion. FGNET-RH initially uses LSTM networks to encode the mention in relation with its context, later it forms a graph to distill/refine the mention\u2019s encodings in the hyperbolic space. Finally, the refined mention encoding is used for entity typing. Experimentation using different benchmark datasets shows that FGNET-RH improves the performance on FG-NET by up to 3.5% in terms of strict accuracy.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11212, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The brain is a prominent example of a biological system with complex behaviors. The number of possible patterns of spikes emitted by a local brain circuit is combinatorially large, although the brain may not make use of all of them. Understanding which of these possible patterns are actually used by the brain, and how those sets of patterns change as properties of neural circuitry change is a major goal in neuroscience. Recently, tools from information geometry have been used to study embeddings of probabilistic models onto a hierarchy of model manifolds that encode how model outputs change as a function of their parameters, giving a quantitative notion of \"distances\" between outputs. We apply this method to a network model of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations to understand how the competition between membrane and synaptic response timescales shapes the network's information geometry. The hyperbolic embedding allows us to identify the statistical parameters to which the model behavior is most sensitive, and demonstrate how the ranking of these coordinates changes with the balance of excitation and inhibition in the network.", "venue": "Physical Review E", "year": 2024, "citationCount": 0, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1103/physreve.109.024302?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.109.024302, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we constructed a scale-free binary graph for each subject, using internodal time-series correlation of regions-of-interest (ROIs) as a proximity measure. The resulted network could be embedded onto manifolds of various curvature and dimensions. While maintaining the fidelity of embedding (low distortion, high mean average precision), functional brain networks were found to be best represented in the hyperbolic disc. Using a popularity-similarity optimization model (PSOM) on the hyperbolic plane, we reduced the dimension of the network into 2-D hyperbolic space and were able to efficiently visualize the internodal connections of the brain, preserving proximity as distances and angles on the PSOM discs. Each individual PSOM disc revealed decentralized nature of information flow and anatomic relevance. Using the hyperbolic distance on the PSOM disc, we could detect the anomaly of network in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects.
